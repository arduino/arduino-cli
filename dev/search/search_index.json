Support requests should be made to Arduino CLI's dedicated board in the Arduino forum . High quality bug reports and feature requests are valuable contributions to the Arduino CLI project. Before reporting an issue \u00b6 Give the nightly build a test drive to see if your issue was already resolved. Search existing pull requests and issues to see if it was already reported. If you have additional information to provide about an existing issue, please comment there. You can use the Reactions feature if you only want to express support. Qualities of an excellent report \u00b6 The issue title should be descriptive. Vague titles make it difficult to understand the purpose of the issue, which might cause your issue to be overlooked. Provide a full set of steps necessary to reproduce the issue. Demonstration code or commands should be complete and simplified to the minimum necessary to reproduce the issue. Be responsive. We may need you to provide additional information in order to investigate and resolve the issue. If you find a solution to your problem, please comment on your issue report with an explanation of how you were able to fix it and close the issue. Pull Requests \u00b6 To propose improvements or fix a bug, feel free to submit a PR. Legal requirements \u00b6 Before we can accept your contributions you have to sign the Contributor License Agreement Pull request checklist \u00b6 In order to ease code reviews and have your contributions merged faster, here is a list of items you can check before submitting a PR: Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern. PR titles indirectly become part of the CHANGELOG so it's crucial to provide a good record of what change is being made in the title; why it was made will go in the PR description, along with a link to a GitHub issue if it exists. If the PR contains a breaking change, please start the commit message and PR title with the string [breaking] . Don't forget to describe in the PR description and in the UPGRADING.md file what changes users might need to make in their workflow or application due to this PR. A breaking change is a change that forces users to change their code, command-line invocations, build scripts or data files when upgrading from an older version of Arduino CLI. Write tests for the code you wrote. Open your PR against the master branch. Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages . PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and require a lot of work to be merged. Your PR must pass all CI tests before we will merge it. If you're seeing an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change you are making. Prerequisites \u00b6 To build the Arduino CLI from sources you need the following tools to be available in your local environment: Go version 1.20 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line If you want to run integration tests you will also need: A serial port with an Arduino board attached If you're working on the gRPC interface you will also have to: download and install the protoc compiler (use the version required to match the generated code, please note that the latest releases does not follow semantic versioning anymore so, for example, the version 4.23.2 must be searched as 23.2 dropping the major number) install protoc-gen-go using: go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@v1.30.0 (use the version required to match the generated code) install protoc-gen-go-grpc using: go install google.golang.org/grpc/cmd/protoc-gen-go-grpc@v1.3.0 (use the version required to match the generated code) Building the source code \u00b6 From the project folder root, just run: task build The project uses Go modules so dependencies will be downloaded automatically. At the end of the build, you should find an arduino-cli executable in the same folder. Running the tests \u00b6 There are several checks and test suites in place to ensure the code works as expected and is written in a way that's consistent across the whole codebase. To avoid pushing changes that will cause the CI system to fail, you can run most of the tests locally. To ensure code style is consistent, run: task check To run unit tests: task go:test To run integration tests (these will take some time and require special setup, see following paragraph): task go:integration-test Running only some tests \u00b6 By default, all tests from all go packages are run. To run only unit tests from one or more specific packages, you can set the TARGETS environment variable, e.g.: TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task go:test Alternatively, to run only some specific test(s), you can specify a regex to match against the test function name: TEST_REGEX='^TestTryBuild.*' task go:test Both can be combined as well, typically to run only a specific test: TEST_REGEX='^TestFindBoardWithFQBN$' TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task go:test Integration tests \u00b6 Being a command line interface, Arduino CLI is heavily interactive and it has to stay consistent in accepting the user input and providing the expected output and proper exit codes. On top of this, many Arduino CLI features involve communicating with external devices, most likely through a serial port, so unit tests can only go so far in giving us confidence that the code is working. For these reasons, in addition to regular unit tests the project has a suite of integration tests that actually run Arduino CLI in a different process and assess the options are correctly understood and the output is what we expect. Hardware requirements for running the full suite of integration tests: \u00b6 An Arduino board attached to a serial port. The board must: Use one of the VID/PID pairs used by Arduino or their partners (as is the case with all modern official Arduino boards except the classic Nano). Accept uploads using the FQBN associated with that VID/PID (which will be the case unless you have installed a custom bootloader or removed the bootloader). Note that running the integration tests will result in a sketch being uploaded to every attached Arduino board meeting the above requirements. Software requirements for running integration tests: \u00b6 A working Go environment. Chances are that you already have Go installed in your system, if this is not the case you can download the official distribution or use the package manager provided by your Operating System. Running tests \u00b6 After the software requirements have been installed you should be able to run the tests with: task go:integration-test This will run the integration tests automatically. To run specific packages you must run go test . go test -v github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/internal/integrationtest/lib To run very specific test functions: go test -v github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/internal/integrationtest/lib -run TestLibUpgradeCommand Dependency license metadata \u00b6 Metadata about the license types of all dependencies is cached in the repository. To update this cache, run the following command from the repository root folder: task general:cache-dep-licenses The necessary Licensed tool can be installed by following these instructions . Configuration files formatting \u00b6 To keep the configurations tidy and in order we use Prettier to automatically format all YAML files in the project. Keeping and enforcing a formatting standard helps everyone make small PRs and avoids the introduction of formatting changes made by unconfigured editors. There are several ways to run Prettier. If you're using Visual Studio Code you can easily use the prettier-vscode extension to automatically format as you write. Otherwise you can use the following tasks. To do so you'll need to install npm if not already installed. Check the official documentation to learn how to install npm for your platform. Ensure the formatting is compliant by running the command: task general:format-prettier When opening a new Pull Request, checks are automatically run to verify that configuration files are correctly formatted. In case of failures we might ask you to update the PR with correct formatting. Working on docs \u00b6 Documentation is provided to final users in form of static HTML content generated from a tool called MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages . Local development \u00b6 Most of the documentation consists of static content written over several Markdown files under the docs folder at the root of this git repository but some other content is dynamically generated from the CI pipelines - this is the case with the command line reference and the gRPC interface, for example. If you want to check out how the documentation would look after some local changes, you might need to reproduce what happens in the CI, generating the full documentation website from your personal computer. To run the docs toolchain locally, you need to have a few dependencies and tools installed: Go version 1.17 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line A working Python environment, see this paragraph if you need to setup one Before running the toolchain, perform the following operations from the root of the git repository (if you have a Python virtual environment, activate it before proceeding): go get -u github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc poetry install When working on docs, you can launch a command that will take care of generating the docs, build the static website and start a local server you can later access with a web browser to see a preview of your changes. From the root of the git repository run: task website:serve If you don't see any error, hit http://127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser to navigate the generated docs. Docs publishing \u00b6 The present git repository has a special branch called gh-pages that contains the generated HTML code for the docs website; every time a change is pushed to this special branch, GitHub automatically triggers a deployment to pull the change and publish a new version of the website. Do not open Pull Requests to push changes to the gh-pages branch, that will be done exclusively from the CI. Docs formatting \u00b6 To keep the documentation tidy and in order we use Prettier to automatically format all Markdown files in the project. Keeping and enforcing a formatting standard helps everyone make small PRs and avoids the introduction of formatting changes made by unconfigured editors. There are several ways to run Prettier. If you're using Visual Studio Code you can easily use the prettier-vscode extension to automatically format as you write. Otherwise you can use the following tasks.

Ensure the formatting is compliant by running the command: task general:format-prettier When opening a new Pull Request, checks are automatically run to verify that documentation is correctly formatted. In case of failures we might ask you to update the PR with correct formatting. Docs automation \u00b6 In order to avoid unwanted changes to the public website hosting the Arduino CLI documentation, only Mike is allowed to push changes to the gh-pages branch, and this only happens from within the CI, in a workflow named Deploy Website . Details on the documentation publishing system are available here . Internationalization (i18n) \u00b6 In order to support i18n in the CLI, any messages that are intended to be translated should be wrapped in a call to i18n.Tr . This call allows us to build a catalog of translatable strings, replacing the reference string at runtime with the localized value. Example usage: package main import ( \"fmt\" \"github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/i18n\" ) func main () { fmt . Println ( i18n . Tr ( \"Hello World!\" )) } About easyjson golang library \u00b6 We use the hi-performance easyjson library to parse the large JSON index files for libraries and platforms. To obtain the best performance we must do some code generation, this is done via task go:easyjson-generate . If you ever touch source code using the easyjson library, make sure to re-run the go:easyjson-generate task to see if there are changes in the generated code. Additional settings \u00b6 If you need to push a commit that's only shipping documentation changes or example files, thus a complete no-op for the test suite, please start the commit message with the string [skip ci] to skip the build and give that slot to someone else who does need it. If your PR doesn't need to be included in the changelog, please start the commit message and PR title with the string [skip changelog]","title":"How to contribute"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute","text":"First of all, thanks for contributing!

For example, for JSON output: $ arduino-cli outdated --format json { \"platforms\": [ { \"id\": \"arduino:avr\", \"installed\": \"1.6.3\", \"latest\": \"1.8.6\", \"name\": \"Arduino AVR Boards\", ... } ], \"libraries\": [ { \"library\": { \"name\": \"USBHost\", \"author\": \"Arduino\", \"maintainer\": \"Arduino \\u003cinfo@arduino.cc\\u003e\", \"category\": \"Device Control\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", ... }, \"release\": { \"author\": \"Arduino\", \"version\": \"1.0.5\", \"maintainer\": \"Arduino \\u003cinfo@arduino.cc\\u003e\", \"category\": \"Device Control\", ... } } ] } Command compile does not support --vid-pid flag anymore \u00b6 It was a legacy and undocumented feature that is now useless. The corresponding field in gRPC CompileRequest.vid_pid has been removed as well. golang API: method github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries/Library.LocationPriorityFor removed \u00b6 That method was outdated and must not be used. 0.31.0 \u00b6 Added post_install script support for tools \u00b6 The post_install script now runs when a tool is correctly installed and the CLI is in \"interactive\" mode. This behavior can be configured . golang API: methods in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/cores/packagemanager changed signature \u00b6 The following methods in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/cores/packagemanager : func ( pme * Explorer ) InstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { ... } func ( pme * Explorer ) RunPostInstallScript ( platformRelease * cores . PlatformRelease ) error { ... } have changed. InstallTool requires the new skipPostInstall parameter, which must be set to true to skip the post install script. RunPostInstallScript does not require a *cores.PlatformRelease parameter but requires a *paths.Path parameter: func ( pme * Explorer ) InstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB , skipPostInstall bool ) error { ... } func ( pme * Explorer ) RunPostInstallScript ( installDir * paths . Path ) error { ... } 0.30.0 \u00b6 Sketch name validation \u00b6 The sketch name submitted via the sketch new command of the CLI or the gRPC command cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.NewSketch are now validated. The applied rules follow the sketch specifications . Existing sketch names violating the new constraint need to be updated. daemon CLI command's --ip flag removal \u00b6 The daemon CLI command no longer allows to set a custom ip for the gRPC communication. Currently there is not enough bandwith to support this feature. For this reason, the --ip flag has been removed. board attach CLI command changed behaviour \u00b6 The board attach CLI command has changed behaviour: now it just pick whatever port and FQBN is passed as parameter and saves it in the sketch.yaml file, without any validity check or board autodetection. The sketch.json file is now completely ignored. cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.BoardAttach gRPC interface command removal \u00b6 The cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.BoardAttach gRPC command has been removed. This feature is no longer available through gRPC. golang API: methods in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/upload changed return type \u00b6 The following methods in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/upload : func Upload ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UploadRequest , outStream io . Writer , errStream io . Writer ) ( * rpc . UploadResponse , error ) { ... } func UsingProgrammer ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UploadUsingProgrammerRequest , outStream io . Writer , errStream io . Writer ) ( * rpc . UploadUsingProgrammerResponse , error ) { ... } do not return anymore the response (because it's always empty): func Upload ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UploadRequest , outStream io . Writer , errStream io . Writer ) error { ... } func UsingProgrammer ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UploadUsingProgrammerRequest , outStream io . Writer , errStream io . Writer ) error { ... } golang API: methods in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/compile changed signature \u00b6 The following method in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/compile : func Compile ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . CompileRequest , outStream , errStream io . Writer , progressCB rpc . TaskProgressCB , debug bool ) ( r * rpc . CompileResponse , e error ) { ... } do not require the debug parameter anymore: func Compile ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . CompileRequest , outStream , errStream io . Writer , progressCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) ( r * rpc . CompileResponse , e error ) { ... } golang API: package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/cli is no more public \u00b6 The package cli has been made internal. The code in this package is no more public API and can not be directly imported in other projects. golang API change in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries/librariesmanager.LibrariesManager \u00b6 The following LibrariesManager.InstallPrerequisiteCheck methods have changed prototype, from: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallPrerequisiteCheck ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) ( * paths . Path , * libraries . Library , error ) { ... } func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallZipLib ( ctx context . Context , archivePath string , overwrite bool ) error { ... } to func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallPrerequisiteCheck ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) ( * paths . Path , * libraries . Library , error ) { ... } func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallZipLib ( ctx context . Context , archivePath * paths . Path , overwrite bool ) error { ... } InstallPrerequisiteCheck now requires an explicit name and version instead of a librariesindex.Release , because it can now be used to check any library, not only the libraries available in the index. Also the return value has changed to a LibraryInstallPlan structure, it contains the same information as before ( TargetPath and ReplacedLib ) plus Name , Version , and an UpToDate boolean flag. InstallZipLib method archivePath is now a paths.Path instead of a string . golang API change in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/rduino/cores/packagemanager.Explorer \u00b6 The packagemanager.Explorer method FindToolsRequiredForBoard : func ( pme * Explorer ) FindToolsRequiredForBoard ( board * cores . Board ) ([] * cores . ToolRelease , error ) { ... } has been renamed to `FindToolsRequiredForBuild: func ( pme * Explorer ) FindToolsRequiredForBuild ( platform , buildPlatform * cores . PlatformRelease ) ([] * cores . ToolRelease , error ) { ... } moreover it now requires the platform and the buildPlatform (a.k.a. the referenced platform core used for the compile) instead of the board . Usually these two value are obtained from the Explorer.ResolveFQBN(...) method. 0.29.0 \u00b6 Removed gRPC API: cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.UpdateCoreLibrariesIndex , Outdated , and Upgrade \u00b6 The following gRPC API have been removed: cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.UpdateCoreLibrariesIndex : you can use the already available gRPC methods UpdateIndex and UpdateLibrariesIndex to perform the same tasks. cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.Outdated : you can use the already available gRPC methods PlatformList and LibraryList to perform the same tasks. cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.Upgrade : you can use the already available gRPC methods PlatformUpgrade and LibraryUpgrade to perform the same tasks. The golang API implementation of the same functions has been removed as well, so the following function are no more available: github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.UpdateCoreLibrariesIndex(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/outdated.Outdated(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/upgrade.Upgrade(...) you can use the following functions as a replacement to do the same tasks: github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.UpdateLibrariesIndex(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.UpdateIndex(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/core.GetPlatforms(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/lib.LibraryList(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/lib.LibraryUpgrade(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/lib.LibraryUpgradeAll(...) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/core.PlatformUpgrade(...) Changes in golang functions github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/cli/instance.Init and InitWithProfile \u00b6 The following functions: func Init ( instance * rpc . Instance ) [] error { } func InitWithProfile ( instance * rpc . Instance , profileName string , sketchPath * paths . Path ) ( * rpc . Profile , [] error ) { } no longer return the errors array: func Init ( instance * rpc . Instance ) { } func InitWithProfile ( instance * rpc . Instance , profileName string , sketchPath * paths . Path ) * rpc . Profile { } The errors are automatically sent to output via feedback package, as for the other Init* functions. 0.28.0 \u00b6 Breaking changes in libraries name handling \u00b6 In the structure github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries.Library the field: RealName has been renamed to Name Name has been renamed to DirName Now Name is the name of the library as it appears in the library.properties file and DirName it's the name of the directory containing the library. The DirName is usually the name of the library with non-alphanumeric characters converted to underscore, but it could be actually anything since the directory where the library is installed can be freely renamed. This change improves the overall code base naming coherence since all the structures involving libraries have the Name field that refers to the library name as it appears in the library.properties file. gRPC message cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.Library no longer has real_name field \u00b6 You must use the name field instead. Machine readable lib list output no longer has \"real name\" field \u00b6 JSON \u00b6 The [*].library.real_name field has been removed. You must use the [*].library.name field instead. YAML \u00b6 The [*].library.realname field has been removed. You must use the [*].library.name field instead. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries/librariesmanager.LibrariesManager.Install removed parameter installLocation \u00b6 The method: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) Install ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , libPath * paths . Path , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) error { ... } no more needs the installLocation parameter: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) Install ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , libPath * paths . Path ) error { ... } The install location is determined from the libPath. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries/librariesmanager.LibrariesManager.FindByReference now returns a list of libraries. \u00b6 The method: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) FindByReference ( libRef * librariesindex . Reference , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) * libraries . Library { ... } has been changed to: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) FindByReference ( libRef * librariesindex . Reference , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) libraries . List { ... } the method now returns all the libraries matching the criteria and not just the first one. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries/librariesmanager.LibraryAlternatives removed \u00b6 The structure librariesmanager.LibraryAlternatives has been removed. The libraries.List object can be used as a replacement. Breaking changes in UpdateIndex API (both gRPC and go-lang) \u00b6 The gRPC message cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.DownloadProgress has been changed from: message DownloadProgress { // URL of the download. string url = 1; // The file being downloaded. string file = 2; // Total size of the file being downloaded. int64 total_size = 3; // Size of the downloaded portion of the file. int64 downloaded = 4; // Whether the download is complete. bool completed = 5; } to message DownloadProgress { oneof message { DownloadProgressStart start = 1; DownloadProgressUpdate update = 2; DownloadProgressEnd end = 3; } } message DownloadProgressStart { // URL of the download. string url = 1; // The label to display on the progress bar. string label = 2; } message DownloadProgressUpdate { // Size of the downloaded portion of the file. int64 downloaded = 1; // Total size of the file being downloaded. int64 total_size = 2; } message DownloadProgressEnd { // True if the download is successful bool success = 1; // Info or error message, depending on the value of 'success'. Some examples: // \"File xxx already downloaded\" or \"Connection timeout\" string message = 2; } The new message format allows a better handling of the progress update reports on downloads. Every download now will report a sequence of message as follows: DownloadProgressStart{url=\"https://...\", label=\"Downloading package index...\"} DownloadProgressUpdate{downloaded=0, total_size=103928} DownloadProgressUpdate{downloaded=29380, total_size=103928} DownloadProgressUpdate{downloaded=69540, total_size=103928} DownloadProgressEnd{success=true, message=\"\"} or if an error occurs: DownloadProgressStart{url=\"https://...\", label=\"Downloading package index...\"} DownloadProgressUpdate{downloaded=0, total_size=103928} DownloadProgressEnd{success=false, message=\"Server closed connection\"} or if the file is already cached: DownloadProgressStart{url=\"https://...\", label=\"Downloading package index...\"} DownloadProgressEnd{success=true, message=\"Index already downloaded\"} About the go-lang API the following functions in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands : func UpdateIndex ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UpdateIndexRequest , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) ( * rpc . UpdateIndexResponse , error ) { ... } have changed their signature to: func UpdateIndex ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . UpdateIndexRequest , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB , downloadResultCB rpc . DownloadResultCB ) error { ... } UpdateIndex do not return anymore the latest UpdateIndexResponse (beacuse it was always empty). 0.27.0 \u00b6 Breaking changes in golang API github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/cores/packagemanager.PackageManager \u00b6 The PackageManager API has been heavily refactored to correctly handle multitasking and concurrency. Many fields in the PackageManager object are now private. All the PackageManager methods have been moved into other objects. In particular: the methods that query the PackageManager without changing its internal state, have been moved into the new Explorer object the methods that change the PackageManager internal state, have been moved into the new Builder object. The Builder object must be used to create a new PackageManager . Previously the function NewPackageManager was used to get a clean PackageManager object and then use the LoadHardware* methods to build it. Now the function NewBuilder must be used to create a Builder , run the LoadHardware* methods to load platforms, and finally call the Builder.Build() method to obtain the final PackageManager . Previously we did: pm := packagemanager . NewPackageManager ( ... ) err = pm . LoadHardware () err = pm . LoadHardwareFromDirectories ( ... ) err = pm . LoadHardwareFromDirectory ( ... ) err = pm . LoadToolsFromPackageDir ( ... ) err = pm . LoadToolsFromBundleDirectories ( ... ) err = pm . LoadToolsFromBundleDirectory ( ... ) pack = pm . GetOrCreatePackage ( \"packagername\" ) // ...use `pack` to tweak or load more hardware... err = pm . LoadPackageIndex ( ... ) err = pm . LoadPackageIndexFromFile ( ... ) err = pm . LoadHardwareForProfile ( ... ) // ...use `pm` to implement business logic... Now we must do: var pm * packagemanager . PackageManager { pmb := packagemanager . Newbuilder ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadHardware () err = pmb . LoadHardwareFromDirectories ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadHardwareFromDirectory ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadToolsFromPackageDir ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadToolsFromBundleDirectories ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadToolsFromBundleDirectory ( ... ) pack = pmb . GetOrCreatePackage ( \"packagername\" ) // ...use `pack` to tweak or load more hardware... err = pmb . LoadPackageIndex ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadPackageIndexFromFile ( ... ) err = pmb . LoadHardwareForProfile ( ... ) pm = pmb . Build () } // ...use `pm` to implement business logic... It's not mandatory but highly recommended, to drop the Builder object once it has built the PackageManager (that's why in the example the pmb builder is created in a limited scope between braces). To query the PackagerManager now it is required to obtain an Explorer object through the PackageManager.NewExplorer() method. Previously we did: func DoStuff ( pm * packagemanager . PackageManager , ... ) { // ...implement business logic through PackageManager methods... ... := pm . Packages ... := pm . CustomGlobalProperties ... := pm . FindPlatform ( ... ) ... := pm . FindPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . FindPlatformReleaseDependencies ( ... ) ... := pm . DownloadToolRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . DownloadPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . IdentifyBoard ( ... ) ... := pm . DownloadAndInstallPlatformUpgrades ( ... ) ... := pm . DownloadAndInstallPlatformAndTools ( ... ) ... := pm . InstallPlatform ( ... ) ... := pm . InstallPlatformInDirectory ( ... ) ... := pm . RunPostInstallScript ( ... ) ... := pm . IsManagedPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . UninstallPlatform ( ... ) ... := pm . InstallTool ( ... ) ... := pm . IsManagedToolRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . UninstallTool ( ... ) ... := pm . IsToolRequired ( ... ) ... := pm . LoadDiscoveries ( ... ) ... := pm . GetProfile ( ... ) ... := pm . GetEnvVarsForSpawnedProcess ( ... ) ... := pm . DiscoveryManager ( ... ) ... := pm . FindPlatformReleaseProvidingBoardsWithVidPid ( ... ) ... := pm . FindBoardsWithVidPid ( ... ) ... := pm . FindBoardsWithID ( ... ) ... := pm . FindBoardWithFQBN ( ... ) ... := pm . ResolveFQBN ( ... ) ... := pm . Package ( ... ) ... := pm . GetInstalledPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . GetAllInstalledToolsReleases ( ... ) ... := pm . InstalledPlatformReleases ( ... ) ... := pm . InstalledBoards ( ... ) ... := pm . FindToolsRequiredFromPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pm . GetTool ( ... ) ... := pm . FindToolsRequiredForBoard ( ... ) ... := pm . FindToolDependency ( ... ) ... := pm . FindDiscoveryDependency ( ... ) ... := pm . FindMonitorDependency ( ... ) } Now we must obtain the Explorer object to access the same methods, moreover, we must call the release callback function once we complete the task: func DoStuff ( pm * packagemanager . PackageManager , ... ) { pme , release := pm . NewExplorer () defer release () ... := pme . GetPackages () ... := pme . GetCustomGlobalProperties () ... := pme . FindPlatform ( ... ) ... := pme . FindPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . FindPlatformReleaseDependencies ( ... ) ... := pme . DownloadToolRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . DownloadPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . IdentifyBoard ( ... ) ... := pme . DownloadAndInstallPlatformUpgrades ( ... ) ... := pme . DownloadAndInstallPlatformAndTools ( ... ) ... := pme . InstallPlatform ( ... ) ... := pme . InstallPlatformInDirectory ( ... ) ... := pme . RunPostInstallScript ( ... ) ... := pme . IsManagedPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . UninstallPlatform ( ... ) ... := pme . InstallTool ( ... ) ... := pme . IsManagedToolRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . UninstallTool ( ... ) ... := pme . IsToolRequired ( ... ) ... := pme . LoadDiscoveries ( ... ) ... := pme . GetProfile ( ... ) ... := pme . GetEnvVarsForSpawnedProcess ( ... ) ... := pme . DiscoveryManager ( ... ) ... := pme . FindPlatformReleaseProvidingBoardsWithVidPid ( ... ) ... := pme . FindBoardsWithVidPid ( ... ) ... := pme . FindBoardsWithID ( ... ) ... := pme . FindBoardWithFQBN ( ... ) ... := pme . ResolveFQBN ( ... ) ... := pme . Package ( ... ) ... := pme . GetInstalledPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . GetAllInstalledToolsReleases ( ... ) ... := pme . InstalledPlatformReleases ( ... ) ... := pme . InstalledBoards ( ... ) ... := pme . FindToolsRequiredFromPlatformRelease ( ... ) ... := pme . GetTool ( ... ) ... := pme . FindToolsRequiredForBoard ( ... ) ... := pme . FindToolDependency ( ... ) ... := pme . FindDiscoveryDependency ( ... ) ... := pme . FindMonitorDependency ( ... ) } The Explorer object keeps a read-lock on the underlying PackageManager that must be released once the task is done by calling the release callback function. This ensures that no other task will change the status of the PackageManager while the current task is in progress. The PackageManager.Clean() method has been removed and replaced by the methods: PackageManager.NewBuilder() (*Builder, commit func()) Builder.BuildIntoExistingPackageManager(target *PackageManager) Previously, to update a PackageManager instance we did: func Reload ( pm * packagemanager . PackageManager ) { pm . Clear () ... = pm . LoadHardware ( ... ) // ...other pm.Load* calls... } now we have two options: func Reload ( pm * packagemanager . PackageManager ) { // Create a new builder and build a package manager pmb := packagemanager . NewBuilder ( ... /* config params */ ) ... = pmb . LoadHardware ( ... ) // ...other pmb.Load* calls... // apply the changes to the original pm pmb . BuildIntoExistingPackageManager ( pm ) } in this case, we create a new Builder with the given config params and once the package manager is built we apply the changes atomically with BuildIntoExistingPackageManager . This procedure may be even more simplified with: func Reload ( pm * packagemanager . PackageManager ) { // Create a new builder using the same config params // as the original package manager pmb , commit := pm . NewBuilder () // build the new package manager ... = pmb . LoadHardware ( ... ) // ...other pmb.Load* calls... // apply the changes to the original pm commit () } In this case, we don't even need to bother to provide the configuration parameters because they are taken from the previous PackageManager instance. Some gRPC-mapped methods now accepts the gRPC request instead of the instance ID as parameter \u00b6 The following methods in subpackages of github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/* : func Watch ( instanceID int32 ) ( <- chan * rpc . BoardListWatchResponse , func (), error ) { ... } func LibraryUpgradeAll ( instanceID int32 , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { ... } func LibraryUpgrade ( instanceID int32 , libraryNames [] string , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { ... } have been changed to: func Watch ( req * rpc . BoardListWatchRequest ) ( <- chan * rpc . BoardListWatchResponse , func (), error ) { ... } func LibraryUpgradeAll ( req * rpc . LibraryUpgradeAllRequest , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { ... } func LibraryUpgrade ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . LibraryUpgradeRequest , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { ... } The following methods in package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands func GetInstance ( id int32 ) * CoreInstance { ... } func GetPackageManager ( id int32 ) * packagemanager . PackageManager { ... } func GetLibraryManager ( instanceID int32 ) * librariesmanager . LibrariesManager { ... } have been changed to: func GetPackageManager ( instance rpc . InstanceCommand ) * packagemanager . PackageManager { ... } // Deprecated func GetPackageManagerExplorer ( req rpc . InstanceCommand ) ( explorer * packagemanager . Explorer , release func ()) { ... } func GetLibraryManager ( req rpc . InstanceCommand ) * librariesmanager . LibrariesManager { ... } Old code passing the instanceID inside the gRPC request must be changed to pass directly the whole gRPC request, for example: eventsChan , closeWatcher , err := board . Watch ( req . Instance . Id ) must be changed to: eventsChan , closeWatcher , err := board . Watch ( req ) Removed detection of Arduino IDE bundling \u00b6 Arduino CLI does not check anymore if it's bundled with the Arduino IDE 1.x. Previously this check allowed the Arduino CLI to automatically use the libraries and tools bundled in the Arduino IDE, now this is not supported anymore unless the configuration keys directories.builtin.libraries and directories.builtin.tools are set. gRPC enumeration renamed enum value in cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.LibraryLocation \u00b6 LIBRARY_LOCATION_IDE_BUILTIN has been renamed to LIBRARY_LOCATION_BUILTIN go-lang API change in LibraryManager \u00b6 The following methods: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallPrerequisiteCheck ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release ) ( * paths . Path , * libraries . Library , error ) { ... } func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) Install ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , libPath * paths . Path ) error { ... ] func ( alts * LibraryAlternatives ) FindVersion ( version * semver . Version , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) * libraries . Library { ... } func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) FindByReference ( libRef * librariesindex . Reference ) * libraries . Library { ... } now requires a new parameter LibraryLocation : func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) InstallPrerequisiteCheck ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) ( * paths . Path , * libraries . Library , error ) { ... } func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) Install ( indexLibrary * librariesindex . Release , libPath * paths . Path , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) error { ... ] func ( alts * LibraryAlternatives ) FindVersion ( version * semver . Version , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) * libraries . Library { ... } + func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) FindByReference ( libRef * librariesindex . Reference , installLocation libraries . LibraryLocation ) * libraries . Library { ... } If you're not interested in specifying the LibraryLocation you can use libraries.User to refer to the user directory. go-lang functions changes in github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration.IsBundledInDesktopIDE function has been removed. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration.BundleToolsDirectories has been renamed to BuiltinToolsDirectories github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration.IDEBundledLibrariesDir has been renamed to IDEBuiltinLibrariesDir Removed utils.FeedStreamTo and utils.ConsumeStreamFrom \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/utils.FeedStreamTo and github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/utils.ConsumeStreamFrom are now private. They are mainly used internally for gRPC stream handling and are not suitable to be public API. 0.26.0 \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.DownloadToolRelease , and InstallToolRelease functions have been removed \u00b6 This functionality was duplicated and already available via PackageManager methods. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.Outdated and Upgrade functions have been moved \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.Outdated is now github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/outdated.Outdated github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands.Upgrade is now github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/upgrade.Upgrade Old code must change the imports accordingly. github.com/arduino-cli/arduino/cores/packagemanager.PackageManager methods and fields change \u00b6 The PackageManager.Log and TempDir fields are now private. The PackageManager.DownloadToolRelease method has no more the label parameter: func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadToolRelease ( tool * cores . ToolRelease , config * downloader . Config , label string , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error { has been changed to: func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadToolRelease ( tool * cores . ToolRelease , config * downloader . Config , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error { Old code should remove the label parameter. The PackageManager.UninstallPlatform , PackageManager.InstallTool , and PackageManager.UninstallTool methods now requires a github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/rpc/cc/arduino/cli/commands/v1.TaskProgressCB func ( pm * PackageManager ) UninstallPlatform ( platformRelease * cores . PlatformRelease ) error { func ( pm * PackageManager ) InstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease ) error { func ( pm * PackageManager ) UninstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease ) error { have been changed to: func ( pm * PackageManager ) UninstallPlatform ( platformRelease * cores . PlatformRelease , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { func ( pm * PackageManager ) InstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { func ( pm * PackageManager ) UninstallTool ( toolRelease * cores . ToolRelease , taskCB rpc . TaskProgressCB ) error { If you're not interested in getting the task events you can pass an empty callback function. 0.25.0 \u00b6 go-lang function github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/utils.FeedStreamTo has been changed \u00b6 The function FeedStreamTo has been changed from: func FeedStreamTo ( writer func ( data [] byte )) io . Writer to func FeedStreamTo ( writer func ( data [] byte )) ( io . WriteCloser , context . Context ) The user must call the Close method on the returned io.WriteClose to correctly dispose the streaming channel. The context Done() method may be used to wait for the internal subroutines to complete. 0.24.0 \u00b6 gRPC Monitor service and related gRPC calls have been removed \u00b6 The gRPC Monitor service and the gRPC call Monitor.StreamingOpen have been removed in favor of the new Pluggable Monitor API in the gRPC Commands service: Commands.Monitor : open a monitor connection to a communication port. Commands.EnumerateMonitorPortSettings : enumerate the possible configurations parameters for a communication port. Please refer to the official documentation and the reference client implementation for details on how to use the new API. https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/rpc/commands/#monitorrequest https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/rpc/commands/#monitorresponse https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/rpc/commands/#enumeratemonitorportsettingsrequest https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/rpc/commands/#enumeratemonitorportsettingsresponse https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/blob/master/commands/daemon/term_example/main.go 0.23.0 \u00b6 Arduino IDE builtin libraries are now excluded from the build when running arduino-cli standalone \u00b6 Previously the \"builtin libraries\" in the Arduino IDE 1.8.x were always included in the build process. This wasn't the intended behaviour, arduino-cli should include them only if run as a daemon from the Arduino IDE. Now this is fixed, but since it has been the default behaviour from a very long time we decided to report it here as a breaking change. If a compilation fail for a missing bundled library, you can fix it just by installing the missing library from the library manager as usual. gRPC: Changes in message cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.PlatformReference \u00b6 The gRPC message structure cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.PlatformReference has been renamed to cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.InstalledPlatformReference , and some new fields have been added: install_dir is the installation directory of the platform package_url is the 3rd party platform URL of the platform It is currently used only in cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.CompileResponse , so the field type has been changed as well. Old gRPC clients must only update gRPC bindings. They can safely ignore the new fields if not needed. golang API: github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/cli/globals.DefaultIndexURL has been moved under github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/globals \u00b6 Legacy code should just update the import. golang API: PackageManager.DownloadPlatformRelease no longer need label parameter \u00b6 func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadPlatformRelease ( platform * cores . PlatformRelease , config * downloader . Config , label string , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error { is now: func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadPlatformRelease ( platform * cores . PlatformRelease , config * downloader . Config , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error { Just remove the label parameter from legacy code. 0.22.0 \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino.MultipleBoardsDetectedError field changed type \u00b6 Now the Port field of the error is a github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/rpc/cc/arduino/cli/commands/v1.Port , usually imported as rpc.Port . The old discovery.Port can be converted to the new one using the .ToRPC() method. Function github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/upload.DetectConnectedBoard(...) has been removed \u00b6 Use github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/board.List(...) to detect boards. Function arguments.GetDiscoveryPort(...) has been removed \u00b6 NOTE: the functions in the arguments package doesn't have much use outside of the arduino-cli so we are considering to remove them from the public golang API making them internal . The old function: func ( p * Port ) GetDiscoveryPort ( instance * rpc . Instance , sk * sketch . Sketch ) * discovery . Port { } is now replaced by the more powerful: func ( p * Port ) DetectFQBN ( inst * rpc . Instance ) ( string , * rpc . Port ) { } func CalculateFQBNAndPort ( portArgs * Port , fqbnArg * Fqbn , instance * rpc . Instance , sk * sketch . Sketch ) ( string , * rpc . Port ) { } gRPC: address parameter has been removed from commands.SupportedUserFieldsRequest \u00b6 The parameter is no more needed. Lagacy code will continue to work without modification (the value of the parameter will be just ignored). The content of package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/httpclient has been moved to a different path \u00b6 In particular: UserAgent and NetworkProxy have been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration the remainder of the package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/httpclient has been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/httpclient The old imports must be updated according to the list above. commands.DownloadProgressCB and commands.TaskProgressCB have been moved to package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/rpc/cc/arduino/cli/commands/v1 \u00b6 All references to these types must be updated with the new import. commands.GetDownloaderConfig has been moved to package github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/httpclient \u00b6 All references to this function must be updated with the new import. commands.Download has been removed and replaced by github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/httpclient.DownloadFile \u00b6 The old function must be replaced by the new one that is much more versatile. packagemanager.PackageManager.DownloadToolRelease , packagemanager.PackageManager.DownloadPlatformRelease , and resources.DownloadResource.Download functions change signature and behaviour \u00b6 The following functions: func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadToolRelease ( tool * cores . ToolRelease , config * downloader . Config ) ( * downloader . Downloader , error ) func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadPlatformRelease ( platform * cores . PlatformRelease , config * downloader . Config ) ( * downloader . Downloader , error ) func ( r * DownloadResource ) Download ( downloadDir * paths . Path , config * downloader . Config ) ( * downloader . Downloader , error ) now requires a label and a progress callback parameter, do not return the Downloader object anymore, and they automatically handles the download internally: func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadToolRelease ( tool * cores . ToolRelease , config * downloader . Config , label string , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error func ( pm * PackageManager ) DownloadPlatformRelease ( platform * cores . PlatformRelease , config * downloader . Config , label string , progressCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error func ( r * DownloadResource ) Download ( downloadDir * paths . Path , config * downloader . Config , label string , downloadCB rpc . DownloadProgressCB ) error The new progress parameters must be added to legacy code, if progress reports are not needed an empty stub for label and progressCB must be provided. There is no more need to execute the downloader.Run() or downloader.RunAndPoll(...) method. For example, the old legacy code like: downloader , err := pm . DownloadPlatformRelease ( platformToDownload , config ) if err != nil { ... } if err := downloader . Run (); err != nil { ... } may be ported to the new version as: err := pm . DownloadPlatformRelease ( platformToDownload , config , \"\" , func ( progress * rpc . DownloadProgress ) {}) packagemanager.Load* functions now returns error instead of *status.Status \u00b6 The following functions signature: func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardware () [] * status . Status { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardwareFromDirectories ( hardwarePaths paths . PathList ) [] * status . Status { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardwareFromDirectory ( path * paths . Path ) [] * status . Status { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadToolsFromBundleDirectories ( dirs paths . PathList ) [] * status . Status { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadDiscoveries () [] * status . Status { ... } have been changed to: func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardware () [] error { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardwareFromDirectories ( hardwarePaths paths . PathList ) [] error { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadHardwareFromDirectory ( path * paths . Path ) [] error { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadToolsFromBundleDirectories ( dirs paths . PathList ) [] error { ... } func ( pm * PackageManager ) LoadDiscoveries () [] error { ... } These function no longer returns a gRPC status, so the errors can be handled as any other error . Removed error return from discovery.New(...) function \u00b6 The discovery.New(...) function never fails, so the error has been removed, the old signature: func New ( id string , args ... string ) ( * PluggableDiscovery , error ) { ... } is now: func New ( id string , args ... string ) * PluggableDiscovery { ... } 0.21.0 \u00b6 packagemanager.NewPackageManager function change \u00b6 A new argument userAgent has been added to packagemanager.NewPackageManager , the new function signature is: func NewPackageManager ( indexDir , packagesDir , downloadDir , tempDir * paths . Path , userAgent string ) * PackageManager { The userAgent string must be in the format \"ProgramName/Version\" , for example \"arduino-cli/0.20.1\" . commands.Create function change \u00b6 A new argument extraUserAgent has been added to commands.Create , the new function signature is: func Create ( req * rpc . CreateRequest , extraUserAgent ... string ) ( * rpc . CreateResponse , error ) { extraUserAgent is an array of strings, so multiple user agent may be provided. Each user agent must be in the format \"ProgramName/Version\" , for example \"arduino-cli/0.20.1\" . commands.Compile function change \u00b6 A new argument progressCB has been added to commands.Compile , the new function signature is: func Compile ( ctx context . Context , req * rpc . CompileRequest , outStream , errStream io . Writer , progressCB commands . TaskProgressCB , debug bool ) ( r * rpc . CompileResponse , e error ) { if a callback function is provided the Compile command will call it periodically with progress reports with the percentage of compilation completed, otherwise, if the parameter is nil , no progress reports will be performed. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/cli/arguments.ParseReferences function change \u00b6 The parseArch parameter was removed since it was unused and was always true. This means that the architecture gets always parsed by the function. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/cli/arguments.ParseReference function change \u00b6 The parseArch parameter was removed since it was unused and was always true. This means that the architecture gets always parsed by the function. Furthermore the function now should also correctly interpret packager:arch spelled with the wrong casing. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/executils.NewProcess and executils.NewProcessFromPath function change \u00b6 A new argument extraEnv has been added to executils.NewProcess and executils.NewProcessFromPath , the new function signature is: func NewProcess ( extraEnv [] string , args ... string ) ( * Process , error ) { func NewProcessFromPath ( extraEnv [] string , executable * paths . Path , args ... string ) ( * Process , error ) { The extraEnv params allow to pass environment variables (in addition to the default ones) to the spawned process. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/i18n.Init(...) now requires an empty string to be passed for autodetection of locale \u00b6 For automated detection of locale, change the call from: i18n . Init () to i18n . Init ( \"\" ) github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/legacy/i18n module has been removed (in particular the i18n.Logger ) \u00b6 The i18n.Logger is no longer available. It was mainly used in the legacy builder struct field Context.Logger . The Context.Logger field has been replaced with plain io.Writer fields Contex.Stdout and Context.Stderr . All existing logger functionality has been dropped, for example the Java-Style formatting with tags like {0} {1}... must be replaced with one of the equivalent golang printf-based alternatives and logging levels must be replaced with direct writes to Stdout or Stderr . 0.20.0 \u00b6 board details arguments change \u00b6 The board details command now accepts only the --fqbn or -b flags to specify the FQBN. The previously deprecated board details <FQBN> syntax is no longer supported. board attach arguments change \u00b6 The board attach command now uses --port and -p flags to set board port and --board and -b flags to select its FQBN. The previous syntax board attach <port>|<FQBN> [sketchPath] is no longer supported. --timeout flag in board list command has been replaced by --discovery-timeout \u00b6 The flag --timeout in the board list command is no longer supported. 0.19.0 \u00b6 board list command JSON output change \u00b6 The board list command JSON output has been changed quite a bit, from: $ arduino-cli board list --format json [ { \"address\": \"/dev/ttyACM1\", \"protocol\": \"serial\", \"protocol_label\": \"Serial Port (USB)\", \"boards\": [ { \"name\": \"Arduino Uno\", \"fqbn\": \"arduino:avr:uno\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"pid\": \"0x0043\" } ], \"serial_number\": \"954323132383515092E1\" } ] to: $ arduino-cli board list --format json [ { \"matching_boards\": [ { \"name\": \"Arduino Uno\", \"fqbn\": \"arduino:avr:uno\" } ], \"port\": { \"address\": \"/dev/ttyACM1\", \"label\": \"/dev/ttyACM1\", \"protocol\": \"serial\", \"protocol_label\": \"Serial Port (USB)\", \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x0043\", \"serialNumber\": \"954323132383515092E1\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\" } } } ] The boards array has been renamed matching_boards , each contained object will now contain only name and fqbn . Properties that can be used to identify a board are now moved to the new properties object, it can contain any key name. pid and vid have been moved to properties , serial_number has been renamed serialNumber and moved to properties . The new label field is the name of the port if it should be displayed in a GUI. gRPC interface DebugConfigRequest , UploadRequest , UploadUsingProgrammerRequest , BurnBootloaderRequest , DetectedPort field changes \u00b6 DebugConfigRequest , UploadRequest , UploadUsingProgrammerRequest and BurnBootloaderRequest had their port field change from type string to Port . Port contains the following information: // Port represents a board port that may be used to upload or to monitor a board message Port { // Address of the port (e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`). string address = 1; // The port label to show on the GUI (e.g. \"ttyACM0\") string label = 2; // Protocol of the port (e.g., `serial`, `network`, ...). string protocol = 3; // A human friendly description of the protocol (e.g., \"Serial Port (USB)\" string protocol_label = 4; // A set of properties of the port map<string, string> properties = 5; } The gRPC interface message DetectedPort has been changed from: message DetectedPort { // Address of the port (e.g., `serial:///dev/ttyACM0`). string address = 1; // Protocol of the port (e.g., `serial`). string protocol = 2; // A human friendly description of the protocol (e.g., \"Serial Port (USB)\"). string protocol_label = 3; // The boards attached to the port. repeated BoardListItem boards = 4; // Serial number of connected board string serial_number = 5; } to: message DetectedPort { // The possible boards attached to the port. repeated BoardListItem matching_boards = 1; // The port details Port port = 2; } The properties previously contained directly in the message are now stored in the port property. These changes are necessary for the pluggable discovery. gRPC interface BoardListItem change \u00b6 The vid and pid fields of the BoardListItem message have been removed. They used to only be available when requesting connected board lists, now that information is stored in the port field of DetectedPort . Change public library interface \u00b6 github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/i18n package \u00b6 The behavior of the Init function has changed. The user specified locale code is no longer read from the github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/configuration package and now must be passed directly to Init as a string: i18n . Init ( \"it\" ) Omit the argument for automated locale detection: i18n . Init () github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/builder package \u00b6 GenBuildPath() function has been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package. The signature is unchanged. EnsureBuildPathExists function from has been completely removed, in its place use github.com/arduino/go-paths-helper.MkDirAll() . SketchSaveItemCpp function signature is changed from path string, contents []byte, destPath string to path *paths.Path, contents []byte, destPath *paths.Path . paths is github.com/arduino/go-paths-helper . SketchLoad function has been removed, in its place use New from github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package. - SketchLoad(\"/some/path\", \"\") + sketch.New(paths.New(\"some/path)) } If you need to set a custom build path you must instead set it after creating the Sketch. - SketchLoad(\"/some/path\", \"/my/build/path\") + s, err := sketch.New(paths.New(\"some/path)) + s.BuildPath = paths.new(\"/my/build/path\") } SketchCopyAdditionalFiles function signature is changed from sketch *sketch.Sketch, destPath string, overrides map[string]string to sketch *sketch.Sketch, destPath *paths.Path, overrides map[string]string . github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package \u00b6 Item struct has been removed, use go-paths-helper.Path in its place. NewItem has been removed too, use go-paths-helper.New in its place. GetSourceBytes has been removed, in its place use go-paths-helper.Path.ReadFile . GetSourceStr too has been removed, in its place: - s, err := item.GetSourceStr() + data, err := file.ReadFile() + s := string(data) } ItemByPath type and its member functions have been removed, use go-paths-helper.PathList in its place. Sketch.LocationPath has been renamed to FullPath and its type changed from string to go-paths-helper.Path . Sketch.MainFile type has changed from *Item to go-paths-helper.Path . Sketch.OtherSketchFiles , Sketch.AdditionalFiles and Sketch.RootFolderFiles type has changed from []*Item to go-paths-helper.PathList . New signature has been changed from sketchFolderPath, mainFilePath, buildPath string, allFilesPaths []string to path *go-paths-helper.Path . CheckSketchCasing function is now private, the check is done internally by New . InvalidSketchFoldernameError has been renamed InvalidSketchFolderNameError . github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketches package \u00b6 Sketch struct has been merged with sketch.Sketch struct. Metadata and BoardMetadata structs have been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package. NewSketchFromPath has been deleted, use sketch.New in its place. ImportMetadata is now private called internally by sketch.New . ExportMetadata has been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package. BuildPath has been removed, use sketch.Sketch.BuildPath in its place. CheckForPdeFiles has been moved to github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/sketch package. github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/legacy/builder/types package \u00b6 Sketch has been removed, use sketch.Sketch in its place. SketchToLegacy and SketchFromLegacy have been removed, nothing replaces them. Context.Sketch types has been changed from Sketch to sketch.Sketch . Change in board details response (gRPC and JSON output) \u00b6 The board details output WRT board identification properties has changed, before it was: $ arduino-cli board details arduino:samd:mkr1000 Board name: Arduino MKR1000 FQBN: arduino:samd:mkr1000 Board version: 1.8.11 Debugging supported: \u2714 Official Arduino board: \u2714 Identification properties: VID:0x2341 PID:0x824e VID:0x2341 PID:0x024e VID:0x2341 PID:0x804e VID:0x2341 PID:0x004e [...] $ arduino-cli board details arduino:samd:mkr1000 --format json [...] \"identification_prefs\": [ { \"usb_id\": { \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"pid\": \"0x804e\" } }, { \"usb_id\": { \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"pid\": \"0x004e\" } }, { \"usb_id\": { \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"pid\": \"0x824e\" } }, { \"usb_id\": { \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"pid\": \"0x024e\" } } ], [...] now the properties have been renamed from identification_prefs to identification_properties and they are no longer specific to USB but they can theoretically be any set of key/values: $ arduino-cli board details arduino:samd:mkr1000 Board name: Arduino MKR1000 FQBN: arduino:samd:mkr1000 Board version: 1.8.11 Debugging supported: \u2714 Official Arduino board: \u2714 Identification properties: vid=0x2341 pid=0x804e Identification properties: vid=0x2341 pid=0x004e Identification properties: vid=0x2341 pid=0x824e Identification properties: vid=0x2341 pid=0x024e [...] $ arduino-cli board details arduino:samd:mkr1000 --format json [...] \"identification_properties\": [ { \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x804e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\" } }, { \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x004e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\" } }, { \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x824e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\" } }, { \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x024e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\" } } ] } Change of behaviour of gRPC Init function \u00b6 Previously the Init function was used to both create a new CoreInstance and initialize it, so that the internal package and library managers were already populated with all the information available from *_index.json files, installed platforms and libraries and so on. Now the initialization phase is split into two, first the client must create a new CoreInstance with the Create function, that does mainly two things: create all folders necessary to correctly run the CLI if not already existing create and return a new CoreInstance The Create function will only fail if folders creation is not successful. The returned instance is relatively unusable since no library and no platform is loaded, some functions that don't need that information can still be called though. The Init function has been greatly overhauled and it doesn't fail completely if one or more platforms or libraries fail to load now. Also the option library_manager_only has been removed, the package manager is always initialized and platforms are loaded. The Init was already a server-side streaming function but it would always return one and only one response, this has been modified so that each response is either an error or a notification on the initialization process so that it works more like an actual stream of information. Previously a client would call the function like so: const initReq = new InitRequest () initReq . setLibraryManagerOnly ( false ) const initResp = await new Promise < InitResponse > (( resolve , reject ) => { let resp : InitResponse | undefined = undefined const stream = client . init ( initReq ) stream . on ( \"data\" , ( data : InitResponse ) => ( resp = data )) stream . on ( \"end\" , () => resolve ( resp ! )) stream . on ( \"error\" , ( err ) => reject ( err )) }) const instance = initResp . getInstance () if ( ! instance ) { throw new Error ( \"Could not retrieve instance from the initialize response.\" ) } Now something similar should be done. const createReq = new CreateRequest () const instance = client . create ( createReq ) if ( ! instance ) { throw new Error ( \"Could not retrieve instance from the initialize response.\" ) } const initReq = new InitRequest () initReq . setInstance ( instance ) const initResp = client . init ( initReq ) initResp . on ( \"data\" , ( o : InitResponse ) => { const downloadProgress = o . getDownloadProgress () if ( downloadProgress ) { // Handle download progress } const taskProgress = o . getTaskProgress () if ( taskProgress ) { // Handle task progress } const err = o . getError () if ( err ) { // Handle error } }) await new Promise < void > (( resolve , reject ) => { initResp . on ( \"error\" , ( err ) => reject ( err )) initResp . on ( \"end\" , resolve ) }) Previously if even one platform or library failed to load everything else would fail too, that doesn't happen anymore. Now it's easier for both the CLI and the gRPC clients to handle gracefully platforms or libraries updates that might break the initialization step and make everything unusable. Removal of gRPC Rescan function \u00b6 The Rescan function has been removed, in its place the Init function must be used. Change of behaviour of gRPC UpdateIndex and UpdateLibrariesIndex functions \u00b6 Previously both UpdateIndex and UpdateLibrariesIndex functions implicitly called Rescan so that the internal CoreInstance was updated with the eventual new information obtained in the update. This behaviour is now removed and the internal CoreInstance must be explicitly updated by the gRPC client using the Init function. Removed rarely used golang API \u00b6 The following function from the github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/libraries module is no longer available: func ( lm * LibrariesManager ) UpdateIndex ( config * downloader . Config ) ( * downloader . Downloader , error ) { We recommend using the equivalent gRPC API to perform the update of the index. 0.18.0 \u00b6 Breaking changes in gRPC API and CLI JSON output. \u00b6 Starting from this release we applied a more rigorous and stricter naming conventions in gRPC API following the official guidelines: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/style We also started using a linter to implement checks for gRPC API style errors. This provides a better consistency and higher quality API but inevitably introduces breaking changes. gRPC API breaking changes \u00b6 Consumers of the gRPC API should regenerate their bindings and update all structures naming where necessary. Most of the changes are trivial and falls into the following categories: Service names have been suffixed with ...Service (for example ArduinoCore -> ArduinoCoreService ) Message names suffix has been changed from ...Req / ...Resp to ...Request / ...Response (for example BoardDetailsReq -> BoardDetailsRequest ) Enumerations now have their class name prefixed (for example the enumeration value FLAT in LibraryLayout has been changed to LIBRARY_LAYOUT_FLAT ) Use of lower-snake case on all fields (for example: ID -> id , FQBN -> fqbn , Name -> name , ArchiveFilename -> archive_filename ) Package names are now versioned (for example cc.arduino.cli.commands -> cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1 ) Repeated responses are now in plural form ( identification_pref -> identification_prefs , platform -> platforms ) arduino-cli JSON output breaking changes \u00b6 Consumers of the JSON output of the CLI must update their clients if they use one of the following commands: in core search command the following fields have been renamed: Boards -> boards Email -> email ID -> id Latest -> latest Maintainer -> maintainer Name -> name Website -> website The new output is like: $ arduino-cli core search Due --format json [ { \"id\": \"arduino:sam\", \"latest\": \"1.6.12\", \"name\": \"Arduino SAM Boards (32-bits ARM Cortex-M3)\", \"maintainer\": \"Arduino\", \"website\": \"http://www.arduino.cc/\",

Change type of CompileReq.ExportBinaries message in gRPC interface \u00b6 This change affects only the gRPC consumers. In the CompileReq message the export_binaries property type has been changed from bool to google.protobuf.BoolValue . This has been done to handle settings bindings by gRPC consumers and the CLI in the same way so that they an identical behaviour. 0.15.0 \u00b6 Rename telemetry settings to metrics \u00b6 All instances of the term telemetry in the code and the documentation has been changed to metrics . This has been done to clarify that no data is currently gathered from users of the CLI. To handle this change the users must edit their config file, usually arduino-cli.yaml , and change the telemetry key to metrics . The modification must be done by manually editing the file using a text editor, it can't be done via CLI. No other action is necessary. The default folders for the arduino-cli.yaml are: Linux: /home/<your_username>/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml OS X: /Users/<your_username>/Library/Arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml Windows: C:\\Users\\<your_username>\\AppData\\Local\\Arduino15\\arduino-cli.yaml 0.14.0 \u00b6 Changes in debug command \u00b6 Previously it was required: To provide a debug command line recipe in platform.txt like tools.reciped-id.debug.pattern=..... that will start a gdb session for the selected board. To add a debug.tool definition in the boards.txt to recall that recipe, for example myboard.debug.tool=recipe-id Now: Only the configuration needs to be supplied, the arduino-cli or the GUI tool will figure out how to call and setup the gdb session. An example of configuration is the following: debug.executable={build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf debug.toolchain=gcc debug.toolchain.path={runtime.tools.arm-none-eabi-gcc-7-2017q4.path}/bin/ debug.toolchain.prefix=arm-none-eabi- debug.server=openocd debug.server.openocd.path={runtime.tools.openocd-0.10.0-arduino7.path}/bin/ debug.server.openocd.scripts_dir={runtime.tools.openocd-0.10.0-arduino7.path}/share/openocd/scripts/ debug.server.openocd.script={runtime.platform.path}/variants/{build.variant}/{build.openocdscript} The debug.server.XXXX subkeys are optional and also \"free text\", this means that the configuration may be extended as needed by the specific server. For now only openocd is supported. Anyway, if this change works, any other kind of server may be fairly easily added. The debug.xxx=yyy definitions above may be supplied and overlayed in the usual ways: on platform.txt : definition here will be shared through all boards in the platform on boards.txt as part of a board definition: they will override the global platform definitions on programmers.txt : they will override the boards and global platform definitions if the programmer is selected Binaries export must now be explicitly specified \u00b6 Previously, if the --build-path was not specified, compiling a Sketch would copy the generated binaries in <sketch_folder>/build/<fqbn>/ , uploading to a board required that path to exist and contain the necessary binaries. The --dry-run flag was removed. The default, compile does not copy generated binaries to the sketch folder. The --export-binaries ( -e ) flag was introduced to copy the binaries from the build folder to the sketch one. --export-binaries is not required when using the --output-dir flag. A related configuration key and environment variable has been added to avoid the need to always specify the --export-binaries flag: sketch.always_export_binaries and ARDUINO_SKETCH_ALWAYS_EXPORT_BINARIES . If --input-dir or --input-file is not set when calling upload the command will search for the deterministically created build directory in the temp folder and use the binaries found there. The gRPC interface has been updated accordingly, dryRun is removed. Programmers can't be listed anymore using burn-bootloader -P list \u00b6 The -P flag is used to select the programmer used to burn the bootloader on the specified board. Using -P list to list all the possible programmers for the current board was hackish. This way has been removed in favour of board details <fqbn> --list-programmers . lib install --git-url and --zip-file must now be explicitly enabled \u00b6 With the introduction of the --git-url and --zip-file flags the new config key library.enable_unsafe_install has been added to enable them. This changes the ouput of the config dump command. Change behaviour of --config-file flag with config commands \u00b6 To create a new config file with config init one must now use --dest-dir or the new --dest-file flags. Previously the config file would always be overwritten by this command, now it fails if the it already exists, to force the previous behaviour the user must set the --overwrite flag.","title":"Upgrading"},{"location":"UPGRADING/#upgrading","text":"Here you can find a list of migration guides to handle breaking changes between releases of the CLI.","title":"Upgrading"},{"location":"UPGRADING/#0330","text":"","title":"0.33.0"},{"location":"UPGRADING/#grpc-ccarduinoclicommandsv1compile-command-now-return-expanded-build_properties-by-default","text":"The gRPC cc.arduino.cli.commands.v1.Compile command now return expanded build_properties by default.

Many fields in the PackageManager object are now private. All the PackageManager methods have been moved into other objects. In particular: the methods that query the PackageManager without changing its internal state, have been moved into the new Explorer object the methods that change the PackageManager internal state, have been moved into the new Builder object. The Builder object must be used to create a new PackageManager . Previously the function NewPackageManager was used to get a clean PackageManager object and then use the LoadHardware* methods to build it. Now the function NewBuilder must be used to create a Builder , run the LoadHardware* methods to load platforms, and finally call the Builder.Build() method to obtain the final PackageManager . Previously we did: pm := packagemanager . NewPackageManager ( ... ) err = pm . LoadHardware () err = pm . LoadHardwareFromDirectories ( ... ) err = pm . LoadHardwareFromDirectory ( ... ) err = pm .

It's not mandatory but highly recommended, to drop the Builder object once it has built the PackageManager (that's why in the example the pmb builder is created in a limited scope between braces).

LoadHardware ( ... ) // ...other pmb.Load* calls... // apply the changes to the original pm commit () } In this case, we don't even need to bother to provide the configuration parameters because they are taken from the previous PackageManager instance.","title":"Breaking changes in golang API github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/arduino/cores/packagemanager.PackageManager"},{"location":"UPGRADING/#some-grpc-mapped-methods-now-accepts-the-grpc-request-instead-of-the-instance-id-as-parameter","text":"The following methods in subpackages of github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/commands/* : func Watch ( instanceID int32 ) ( <- chan * rpc .

Now the initialization phase is split into two, first the client must create a new CoreInstance with the Create function, that does mainly two things: create all folders necessary to correctly run the CLI if not already existing create and return a new CoreInstance The Create function will only fail if folders creation is not successful. The returned instance is relatively unusable since no library and no platform is loaded, some functions that don't need that information can still be called though. The Init function has been greatly overhauled and it doesn't fail completely if one or more platforms or libraries fail to load now. Also the option library_manager_only has been removed, the package manager is always initialized and platforms are loaded. The Init was already a server-side streaming function but it would always return one and only one response, this has been modified so that each response is either an error or a notification on the initialization process so that it works more like an actual stream of information. Previously a client would call the function like so: const initReq = new InitRequest () initReq . setLibraryManagerOnly ( false ) const initResp = await new Promise < InitResponse > (( resolve , reject ) => { let resp : InitResponse | undefined = undefined const stream = client . init ( initReq ) stream . on ( \"data\" , ( data : InitResponse ) => ( resp = data )) stream . on ( \"end\" , () => resolve ( resp ! )) stream . on ( \"error\" , ( err ) => reject ( err )) }) const instance = initResp . getInstance () if ( ! instance ) { throw new Error ( \"Could not retrieve instance from the initialize response.\" ) } Now something similar should be done. const createReq = new CreateRequest () const instance = client . create ( createReq ) if ( ! instance ) { throw new Error ( \"Could not retrieve instance from the initialize response.\" ) } const initReq = new InitRequest () initReq . setInstance ( instance ) const initResp = client . init ( initReq ) initResp . on ( \"data\" , ( o : InitResponse ) => { const downloadProgress = o . getDownloadProgress () if ( downloadProgress ) { // Handle download progress } const taskProgress = o . getTaskProgress () if ( taskProgress ) { // Handle task progress } const err = o . getError () if ( err ) { // Handle error } }) await new Promise < void > (( resolve , reject ) => { initResp . on ( \"error\" , ( err ) => reject ( err )) initResp . on ( \"end\" , resolve ) }) Previously if even one platform or library failed to load everything else would fail too, that doesn't happen anymore.

Configuration methods \u00b6 Arduino CLI may be configured in three ways: Command line flags Environment variables Configuration file If a configuration option is configured by multiple methods, the value set by the method highest on the above list overwrites the ones below it. If a configuration option is not set, Arduino CLI uses a default value. arduino-cli config dump displays the current configuration values. Command line flags \u00b6 Arduino CLI's command line flags are documented in the command line help and the Arduino CLI command reference . Example \u00b6 Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the --additional-urls command line flag: $ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json Environment variables \u00b6 All configuration options can be set via environment variables. The variable names start with ARDUINO , followed by the configuration key names, with each component separated by _ . For example, the ARDUINO_DIRECTORIES_USER environment variable sets the directories.user configuration option. On Linux or macOS, you can use the export command to set environment variables. On Windows cmd, you can use the set command . ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS environment variables can be a list of space-separated URLs. Example \u00b6 Setting an additional Boards Manager URL using the ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS environment variable: $ export ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS = https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json Setting multiple additional Boards Manager URLs using the ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS environment variable: $ export ARDUINO_BOARD_MANAGER_ADDITIONAL_URLS = \"https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_mbed_index.json\" Configuration file \u00b6 arduino-cli config init creates or updates a configuration file with the current configuration settings. This allows saving the options set by command line flags or environment variables. For example: arduino-cli config init --additional-urls https://downloads.arduino.cc/packages/package_staging_index.json File name \u00b6 The configuration file must be named arduino-cli , with the appropriate file extension for the file's format. Supported formats \u00b6 arduino-cli config init creates a YAML file, however a variety of common formats are supported: JSON TOML YAML Java properties file HCL envfile INI Locations \u00b6 Configuration files in the following locations are recognized by Arduino CLI: Location specified by the --config-file command line flag Arduino CLI data directory (as configured by directories.data ) If multiple configuration files are present, the one highest on the above list is used.

Let's see some examples. Before you start \u00b6 arduino-cli is a container of commands and each command has its own dedicated help text that can be shown with the help command like this: $ arduino-cli help core Arduino Core operations. Usage: arduino-cli core [command] Examples: ./arduino-cli core update-index Available Commands: download Downloads one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. install Installs one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. list Shows the list of installed platforms. search Search for a core in Boards Manager. uninstall Uninstalls one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies if no more used. update-index Updates the index of cores. upgrade Upgrades one or all installed platforms to the latest version.

(default \"text\") --log-file string Path to the file where logs will be written. --log-format string The output format for the logs, can be [text|json]. --log-level string Messages with this level and above will be logged. -v, --verbose Print the logs on the standard output. Use \"arduino-cli core [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Create a configuration file \u00b6 Arduino CLI doesn't strictly require a configuration file to work because the command line interface provides any possible functionality. However, having one can spare you a lot of typing when issuing a command, so let's go ahead and create it with: $ arduino-cli config init Config file written: /home/luca/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml If you inspect the contents of arduino-cli.yaml , you'll find the available options with their respective default values. For more information, see the configuration documentation . Create a new sketch \u00b6 To create a new sketch named MyFirstSketch in the current directory, run the following command: $ arduino-cli sketch new MyFirstSketch Sketch created in : /home/luca/MyFirstSketch A sketch is a folder containing assets like source files and libraries; the new command creates for you a .ino file called MyFirstSketch.ino containing Arduino boilerplate code: $ cat $HOME /MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino void setup () { } void loop () { } At this point you can use your favourite file editor or IDE to open the file $HOME/MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino and change the code like this: void setup () { pinMode ( LED_BUILTIN , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } Connect the board to your PC \u00b6 The first thing to do upon a fresh install is to update the local cache of available platforms and libraries by running: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded After connecting the board to your PC by using the USB cable, you should be able to check whether it's been recognized by running: $ arduino-cli board list Port Type Board Name FQBN Core /dev/ttyACM1 Serial Port ( USB ) Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 arduino:samd In this example, the MKR1000 board was recognized and from the output of the command you see the platform core called arduino:samd is the one that needs to be installed to make it work. If you see an Unknown board listed, uploading should still work as long as you identify the platform core and use the correct FQBN string. When a board is not detected for whatever reason, you can list all the supported boards and their FQBN strings by running the following: $ arduino-cli board listall mkr Board Name FQBN Arduino MKR FOX 1200 arduino:samd:mkrfox1200 Arduino MKR GSM 1400 arduino:samd:mkrgsm1400 Arduino MKR WAN 1300 arduino:samd:mkrwan1300 Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 arduino:samd:mkrwifi1010 Arduino MKRZERO arduino:samd:mkrzero Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 Install the core for your board \u00b6 To install the arduino:samd platform core, run the following: $ arduino-cli core install arduino:samd Downloading tools... arduino:arm-none-eabi-gcc@4.8.3-2014q1 downloaded arduino:bossac@1.7.0 downloaded arduino:openocd@0.9.0-arduino6-static downloaded arduino:CMSIS@4.5.0 downloaded arduino:CMSIS-Atmel@1.1.0 downloaded arduino:arduinoOTA@1.2.0 downloaded Downloading cores... arduino:samd@1.6.19 downloaded Installing tools...

Now we are ready to compile and upload the sketch. Adding 3rd party cores \u00b6 If your board requires 3rd party core packages to work, you can list the URLs to additional package indexes in the Arduino CLI configuration file. For example, to add the ESP8266 core, edit the configuration file and change the board_manager settings as follows: board_manager : additional_urls : - https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json If you have your package indexes locally installed, you can list their file path in the Arduino CLI configuration file. For example, to add the NRF52832 core, edit the configuration file and change the board_manager settings as follows: board_manager : additional_urls : - https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json - file:///absolute/path/to/your/package_nrf52832_index.json From now on, commands supporting custom cores will automatically use the additional URL from the configuration file: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_nrf52832_index.json Updating index: package_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Alternatively, you can pass a link to the additional package index file with the --additional-urls option, that has to be specified every time and for every command that operates on a 3rd party platform core, for example: $ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 The same applies to the additional package index file provided by file paths: $ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls file:///absolute/path/to/your/package_esp8266com_index.json Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 --additional-urls file:///absolute/path/to/your/package_esp8266com_index.json ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Compile and upload the sketch \u00b6 To compile the sketch you run the compile command, passing the proper FQBN string: $ arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch Sketch uses 9600 bytes ( 3 % ) of program storage space. Maximum is 262144 bytes. To upload the sketch to your board, run the following command, using the serial port your board is connected to: $ arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch No new serial port detected.

Verify successful done in 0 .009 seconds CPU reset. Add libraries \u00b6 If you need to add more functionalities to your sketch, chances are some of the libraries available in the Arduino ecosystem already provide what you need. For example, if you need a debouncing strategy to better handle button inputs, you can try searching for the debouncer keyword: $ arduino-cli lib search debouncer Name: \"Debouncer\" Author: hideakitai Maintainer: hideakitai Sentence: Debounce library for Arduino Paragraph: Debounce library for Arduino Website: https://github.com/hideakitai Category: Timing Architecture: * Types: Contributed Versions: [ 0 .1.0 ] Name: \"FTDebouncer\" Author: Ubi de Feo Maintainer: Ubi de Feo, Sebastian Hunkeler Sentence: An efficient, low footprint, fast pin debouncing library for Arduino Paragraph: This pin state supervisor manages debouncing of buttons and handles transitions between LOW and HIGH state, calling a function and notifying your code of which pin has been activated or deactivated.

The client_example folder contains a sample client code that shows how to interact with the gRPC server. Available services and messages are detailed in the gRPC reference pages. To provide observability for the gRPC server activities besides logs, the daemon mode activates and exposes by default a Prometheus endpoint ( http://localhost:9090/metrics ) that can be fetched for metrics data like: # TYPE daemon_compile counter daemon_compile{buildProperties=\"\",exportFile=\"\",fqbn=\"arduino:samd:mkr1000\",installationID=\"ed6f1f22-1fbe-4b1f-84be-84d035b6369c\",jobs=\"0\",libraries=\"\",preprocess=\"false\",quiet=\"false\",showProperties=\"false\",sketchPath=\"5ff767c6fa5a91230f5cb4e267c889aa61489ab2c4f70f35f921f934c1462cb6\",success=\"true\",verbose=\"true\",vidPid=\"\",warnings=\"\"} 1 1580385724726 # TYPE daemon_board_list counter daemon_board_list{installationID=\"ed6f1f22-1fbe-4b1f-84be-84d035b6369c\",success=\"true\"} 1 1580385724833 The metrics settings are exposed via the metrics section in the CLI configuration: metrics : enabled : true addr : :9090","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#before-you-start","text":"arduino-cli is a container of commands and each command has its own dedicated help text that can be shown with the help command like this: $ arduino-cli help core Arduino Core operations.

But don\u2019t get fooled by its name: Arduino CLI can do much more than the average console application, as shown by Arduino IDE 2.x and Arduino Cloud , which rely on it for similar purposes but each one in a completely different way from the other. In this article we introduce the three pillars of the Arduino CLI, explaining how we designed the software so that it can be effectively leveraged under different scenarios. The first pillar: command line interface \u00b6 Console applications for humans \u00b6 As you might expect, the first way to use the Arduino CLI is from a terminal and by a human, and user experience plays a key role here. The UX is under a continuous improvement process as we want the tool to be powerful without being too complicated. We heavily rely on sub-commands to provide a rich set of different operations logically grouped together, so that users can easily explore the interface while getting very specific contextual help. Console applications for robots \u00b6 Humans are not the only type of customers we want to support and the Arduino CLI was also designed to be used programmatically - think about automation pipelines or a CI / CD system. There are some niceties to observe when you write software that\u2019s supposed to be easy to run when unattended and one in particular is the ability to run without a configuration file. This is possible because every configuration option you find in the arduino-cli.yaml configuration file can be provided either through a command line flag or by setting an environment variable. To give an example, the following commands are all equivalent and will fetch the package index used to work with unstable experimental versions of Arduino's cores: See the configuration documentation for details about Arduino CLI's configuration system. Consistent with the previous paragraph, when it comes to providing output the Arduino CLI aims to be user friendly but also slightly verbose, something that doesn\u2019t play well with robots. This is why we added an option to provide output that\u2019s easy to parse. For example, the following figure shows what getting the software version in JSON format looks like. Even if not related to software design, one last feature that\u2019s worth mentioning is the availability of a one-line installation script that can be used to make the latest version of the Arduino CLI available on most systems with an HTTP client like curl or wget and a shell like bash. For more information on Arduino CLI's command line interface, see the command reference . The second pillar: gRPC interface \u00b6 gRPC is a high performance RPC framework that can efficiently connect client and server applications. The Arduino CLI can act as a gRPC server (we call it daemon mode ), exposing a set of procedures that implement the very same set of features of the command line interface and waiting for clients to connect and use them. To give an idea, the following is some Golang code capable of retrieving the version number of a remote running Arduino CLI server instance: gRPC is language agnostic: even if the example is written in Golang, the programming language used for the client can be Python, JavaScript or any of the many supported ones , leading to a variety of possible scenarios. Arduino IDE 2.x is a good example of how to leverage the daemon mode of the Arduino CLI with a clean separation of concerns: the IDE knows nothing about how to download a core, compile a sketch or talk to an Arduino board and it demands all these features of an Arduino CLI instance. Conversely, the Arduino CLI doesn\u2019t even know that the client that\u2019s connected is the Arduino IDE, and neither does it care. For more information on Arduino CLI's gRPC interface, see the gRPC interface reference . The third pillar: embedding \u00b6 Arduino CLI is written in Golang and the code is organized in a way that makes it easy to use it as a library by including the modules you need in another Golang application at compile time. Both the first and second pillars rely on a common Golang API, a set of functions that abstract all the functionalities offered by the Arduino CLI, so that when we provide a fix or a new feature, they are automatically available to both the command line and gRPC interfaces. The source modules implementing this API can be imported in other Golang programs to embed a full-fledged Arduino CLI. For example, this is how some backend services powering Arduino Cloud can compile sketches and manage libraries. Just to give you a taste of what it means to embed the Arduino CLI, here is how to search for a core using the API: Embedding the Arduino CLI is limited to Golang applications and requires a deep knowledge of its internals. For the average use case, the gRPC interface might be a better alternative. Nevertheless, this remains a valid option that we use and provide support for. Conclusions \u00b6 You can start playing with the Arduino CLI right away. The code is open source and the repo contains example code showing how to implement a gRPC client . If you\u2019re curious about how we designed the low level API, have a look at the commands package and don\u2019t hesitate to leave feedback on the issue tracker if you\u2019ve got a use case that doesn\u2019t fit one of the three pillars.","title":"Integration options"},{"location":"integration-options/#the-three-pillars-of-the-arduino-cli","text":"The Arduino CLI is an open source Command Line Application written in Golang that can be used from a terminal to compile, verify and upload sketches to Arduino boards and that\u2019s capable of managing all the software and tools needed in the process.

The Library Manager allows users to automatically download and install libraries needed in their projects, with an easy to use graphical interface in the Arduino IDE / Arduino IDE 2.0 and Arduino Web Editor as well as arduino-cli lib . More information about how Library Manager works is available here . Arduino development software supports multiple microcontroller architectures (e.g. AVR, SAM, etc), meaning that libraries may need to work on multiple architectures. The new 1.5 library format doesn\u2019t contain special support for cross-architecture libraries, but it does provide a preprocessor based mechanism for libraries to target sections of code to specific architectures. See also \u00b6 Arduino library style guide Library dependency resolution process documentation 1.5 library format (rev. 2.2) \u00b6 Library metadata \u00b6 The most significant addition to the format is the ability to add information about the library itself through a properties file called library.properties . This file allows the Library Manager to search and install a library and its dependencies in an easy and automated way. It must be located in the root of the library folder. library.properties file format \u00b6 The library.properties file is a key=value properties list. Every field in this file is UTF-8 encoded. Unless noted otherwise below, all fields are required . The available fields are: name - the name of the library. Library names must contain only basic letters (A-Z or a-z) and numbers (0-9), spaces ( ), underscores (_), dots (.) and dashes (-). They must start with a letter or number. They must contain at least one letter. Note that libraries with a name value starting with Arduino will no longer be allowed addition to the Library Manager index as these names are now reserved for official Arduino libraries. version - version of the library. Version should be semver compliant. 1.2.0 is correct; 1.2 is accepted; r5, 003, 1.1c are invalid author - name/nickname of the authors and their email addresses (not mandatory) separated by comma (,) maintainer - name and email of the maintainer sentence - a sentence explaining the purpose of the library paragraph - a longer description of the library. The value of sentence will be prepended to this, so you should start by writing the second sentence here category - (defaults to Uncategorized ) allowed values: Display Communication Signal Input/Output Sensors Device Control Timing Data Storage Data Processing Other url - the URL of the library project, for a person to visit. For example, the library's GitHub page. This is used for the \"More info\" links in Library Manager architectures - (defaults to * ) a comma separated list of architectures supported by the library. If the library doesn\u2019t contain architecture specific code use * to match all architectures. This field is used as one factor in determining priority when multiple libraries match an #include directive and to provide a warning message when the library is compiled for a board of an architecture that doesn't match any on the list. depends - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.10/Arduino CLI 0.7.0) (optional) a comma-separated list of dependencies (libraries that are needed to build the current library). The Arduino IDE's Library Manager will offer to install the dependencies during installation of the library. arduino-cli lib install will automatically install the dependencies. Since spaces are allowed in the name of a library, but not commas, you can refer to libraries containing spaces in the name without ambiguity for example: depends=Very long library name, Another library with long-name Version constraints for the dependency may be specified in parentheses after the name: depends=ArduinoHttpClient (>=1.0.0) dot_a_linkage - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.0 / arduino-builder 1.0.0-beta13) (optional) when set to true , the library will be compiled using a .a (archive) file. First, all source files are compiled into .o files as normal. Then instead of including all .o files in the linker command directly, all .o files are saved into a .a file, which is then included in the linker command. 1.5 format library folder structure is required. includes - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.10) (optional) a comma separated list of files of the library to be added to the sketch as #include <...> lines. This property is used with the \"Include library\" command in the Arduino IDE. If the includes property is missing, all the header files (.h) on the root source folder are included. precompiled - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) enables support for .a (archive) and .so (shared object) files. See the \"Precompiled binaries\" section for documentation of the required location in the library for these files. The static library should be linked as an ldflag. The precompiled field has two supported values, which control how any source files in the library are handled: true - Source files are always compiled. This is useful for \"mixed\" libraries, such as those that contain both open source code and the precompiled binary of a closed source component. Support for \"mixed\" libraries was inadvertently lost in Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0, and returned in Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0. full - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If the library provides a precompiled library for the board being compiled for, the source files will not be compiled. If no precompiled library was provided for the selected board, source files are compiled as a fallback. This is useful for precompiling the library to reduce compilation time for specific target hardware, but also providing support for arbitrary boards by compiling the library on demand. ldflags - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) the linker flags to be added. Ex: ldflags=-lm Example: name=WebServer version=1.0.0 author=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com>, Pippo Pluto <pippo@example.com> maintainer=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com> sentence=A library that makes coding a Webserver a breeze. paragraph=Supports HTTP1.1 and you can do GET and POST. category=Communication url=http://example.com/ architectures=avr includes=WebServer.h depends=ArduinoHttpClient Version constraints \u00b6 (available from Arduino IDE 2.0.0-beta.3/Arduino CLI 0.7.0) By default, the latest version of a dependency specified in the depends field of library.properties is installed along with the library. Specifying an exact version or range of versions is also supported. The following operators are available: = equal to > greater than >= greater than or equal to < less than <= less than or equal to ! NOT 1 && AND || OR ( , ) constraint group 1 Available from Arduino IDE 2.0.0-rc7/Arduino CLI 0.22.0 Examples \u00b6 If the library \"ArduinoHttpClient\" has the following releases: 0.1.0 1.0.0 2.0.0 2.1.0 The version of it installed as a dependency would be as follows: depends field value Installs version ArduinoHttpClient 2.1.0 ArduinoHttpClient (=1.0.0) 1.0.0 ArduinoHttpClient (>1.0.0) 2.1.0 ArduinoHttpClient (>=1.0.0) 2.1.0 ArduinoHttpClient (<2.0.0) 1.0.0 ArduinoHttpClient (<=2.0.0) 2.0.0 ArduinoHttpClient (!=1.0.0) 2.1.0 ArduinoHttpClient (>1.0.0 && <2.1.0) 2.0.0 ArduinoHttpClient (<1.0.0 || >2.0.0) 2.1.0 ArduinoHttpClient ((>0.1.0 && <2.0.0) || >2.1.0) 1.0.0 Layout of folders and files \u00b6 Each folder has a specific purpose (sources, examples, documentation, etc). Folders not covered in this specification may be added as needed to future revisions. Library Root folder \u00b6 The library root folder name must start with a basic letter (A-Z or a-z) or number (0-9), followed by basic letters, numbers, underscores (_), dots (.) and dashes (-). The maximum length is 63 characters. Source code \u00b6 For libraries intended to be used with Arduino IDE 1.5.x+ only, the source code resides in the src folder. For example: Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp The source code found in src folder and all its subfolders is compiled and linked in the user\u2019s sketch. Only the src folder is added to the include search path (both when compiling the sketch and the library). When the user imports a library into their sketch (from the Arduino IDE's \"Sketch > Include Library\" menu or the Arduino Web Editor's \"Include\" button), the default behavior (configurable via the library.properties includes field ) is for an #include statement to be added for all header (.h) files in the src/ directory (but not its subfolders). As a result, these header files form something of a de facto interface to your library; in general, the only header files in the root src/ folder should be those that you want to expose to the user's sketch and plan to maintain compatibility with in future versions of the library. Place internal header files in a subfolder of the src/ folder. For backward compatibility with Arduino IDE 1.0.x, the library author may opt to place source code into the root folder, instead of the folder called src . In this case the 1.0 library format is applied and the source code is searched from the library root folder and the utility folder, for example: Servo/Servo.h Servo/Servo.cpp Servo/utility/ServoTimers.h Servo/utility/ServoTimers.cpp This will allow existing 1.0 format libraries to compile under Arduino IDE 1.5.x+ as well, and vice-versa. If a library only needs to run on Arduino IDE 1.5.x+, we recommend placing all source code in the src/ folder. If a library requires recursive compilation of nested source folders, its code must be in the src/ folder (since Arduino IDE 1.0.x doesn\u2019t support recursive compilation, backwards compatibility wouldn\u2019t be possible anyway). Library layout \u00b6 Layout root compiled src compiled utility compiled recursive no recursively no flat yes no yes Precompiled binaries \u00b6 The precompiled field of library.properties enables support for the use of precompiled libraries. This requires providing .a (archive) or .so (shared object) files which are compiled for a particular processor architecture. The target architecture of the files is indicated by folder names. The binaries must be located at src/{build.mcu} , where {build.mcu} is the architecture name of the target the file was compiled for. Ex: cortex-m3 for the Arduino Due. The filenames of the compiled binaries should start with lib (e.g., libFoo.a ). (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0) The floating point ABI configuration of ARM core microcontrollers may be adjusted via compiler flags. An extra subfolder level can be used to provide files compiled for a specific floating point configuration: src/{build.mcu}/{build.fpu}-{build.float-abi} , where {build.fpu} is the value of the -mfpu compiler flag and {build.float-abi} is the value of the -mfloat-abi compiler flag. (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If floating point configuration flags are used but no folder matching that configuration is found, src/{build.mcu} is used as a fallback. Below is an example library src folder structure that provides: Header file containing the declarations for the library API. Source file to use as a fallback for other architectures ( precompiled=full mode). Archive file for the ARM Cortex M0+ architecture of the Arduino SAMD boards. Archive file for the ARM Cortex M4 architecture of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, as a fallback for backwards compatibility with Arduino development software before the floating point configuration support was added. Archive file for the ARM Cortex M4 architecture of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, compiled for the -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 floating point ABI configuration.

Note that the examples folder name must be written exactly like that (with lower case letters). Servo/examples/... Sketches contained inside the examples folder will be shown in the Examples menu of the Arduino IDE and Arduino Web Editor. More information: Arduino sketch specification Style guide for Arduino examples Extra documentation \u00b6 An extras folder can be used by the developer to put documentation or other items to be bundled with the library. Remember that files placed inside this folder will increase the size of the library, so putting a 20MB PDF in a library that weights a few kilobytes may not be such a good idea. The content of the extras folder is totally ignored by the Arduino development software; you are free to put anything inside. Keywords \u00b6 A list of keywords for the library may be specified in a file named keywords.txt located in the root of the library folder. When a keyword of any installed library is used in a sketch the Arduino IDE colors it. Servo/keywords.txt An example keywords.txt file: # Syntax Coloring Map For ExampleLibrary # Datatypes (KEYWORD1) Test KEYWORD1 # Methods and Functions (KEYWORD2) doSomething KEYWORD2 # Instances (KEYWORD2) # Constants (LITERAL1) This file would cause the Arduino IDE to highlight Test as a data type, and doSomething as a method / function. keywords.txt format \u00b6 keywords.txt is formatted in four fields which are separated by a single true tab (not spaces): KEYWORD KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE REFERENCE_LINK RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE It is permitted to leave a field empty. KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE \u00b6 KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE Use for Theme property KEYWORD1 datatypes editor.data_type.style KEYWORD2 functions editor.function.style KEYWORD3 structures editor.function.style LITERAL1 constants editor.reserved_word_2.style LITERAL2 ? editor.function.style REFERENCE_LINK \u00b6 This field specifies the Arduino Language Reference page to open via the Arduino IDE's Right Click > Find in Reference or Help > Find in Reference when the cursor is on that keyword. Generally it does not make sense to define the REFERENCE_LINK field for 3rd party library keywords since they are not likely to be in the Arduino Language Reference. RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE \u00b6 In Arduino IDE 1.6.5 and newer this field overrides KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE . In previous IDE versions the RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE field is ignored and KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE is used instead. RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE Theme property KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE equivalent RESERVED_WORD editor.reserved_word.style KEYWORD3 RESERVED_WORD_2 editor.reserved_word_2.style LITERAL1 DATA_TYPE editor.data_type.style KEYWORD1 PREPROCESSOR editor.preprocessor.style KEYWORD3 LITERAL_BOOLEAN editor.literal_boolean.style LITERAL1 Development flag file \u00b6 Normally the Arduino IDE treats the contents of the library folder as read-only. This is to prevent users from accidentally modifying example sketches. During the library development process you may want to edit example sketches in place using the Arduino IDE. With Arduino IDE 1.6.6 and newer, the read-only behavior can be disabled by adding a file named .development to the root of the library folder. A library.properties file must also be present. The Library Manager indexer will not pick up releases that contain a .development file so be sure not to push this file to your remote repository. A complete example \u00b6 A hypothetical library named \"Servo\" that adheres to the specification follows: Servo/ Servo/library.properties Servo/keywords.txt Servo/src/ Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp Servo/src/ServoTimers.h Servo/examples/ Servo/examples/Sweep/Sweep.ino Servo/examples/Pot/Pot.ino Servo/extras/ Servo/extras/Servo_Connectors.pdf Working with multiple architectures \u00b6 Libraries placed in the libraries subfolder of the sketchbook folder (AKA \"user directory\") will be made available for all boards, which may include multiple different processor architectures. To provide architecture-specific code or optimizations, library authors can use the ARDUINO_ARCH_XXX preprocessor macro ( #define ), where XXX is the name of the architecture (as determined by the name of the architecture folder of the board's platform). For example, ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR will be defined when compiling for AVR-based boards. An example: #if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR) // AVR-specific code #elif defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_SAM) // SAM-specific code #else // generic, non-platform specific code #endif Alternatively, if a library only works on certain architectures, you can provide an explicit error message (instead of allowing the compilation to fail in a difficult to understand way): #if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR) // AVR-specific code #elif defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_SAM) // SAM-specific code #else #error \u201cThis library only supports boards with an AVR or SAM processor.\u201d #endif Old library format (pre-1.5) \u00b6 In order to support old libraries (from Arduino IDE 1.0.x), Arduino IDE and Arduino CLI will also compile libraries missing a library.properties metadata file (the header file is still required). As a result, these libraries should behave as they did in Arduino IDE 1.0.x, although they will be available for all boards, including non-AVR ones (which wouldn\u2019t have been present in Arduino IDE 1.0.x).","title":"Library specification"},{"location":"library-specification/#see-also","text":"Arduino library style guide Library dependency resolution process documentation","title":"See also"},{"location":"library-specification/#15-library-format-rev-22","text":"","title":"1.5 library format (rev. 2.2)"},{"location":"library-specification/#library-metadata","text":"The most significant addition to the format is the ability to add information about the library itself through a properties file called library.properties .

This field is used as one factor in determining priority when multiple libraries match an #include directive and to provide a warning message when the library is compiled for a board of an architecture that doesn't match any on the list. depends - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.10/Arduino CLI 0.7.0) (optional) a comma-separated list of dependencies (libraries that are needed to build the current library). The Arduino IDE's Library Manager will offer to install the dependencies during installation of the library. arduino-cli lib install will automatically install the dependencies. Since spaces are allowed in the name of a library, but not commas, you can refer to libraries containing spaces in the name without ambiguity for example: depends=Very long library name, Another library with long-name Version constraints for the dependency may be specified in parentheses after the name: depends=ArduinoHttpClient (>=1.0.0) dot_a_linkage - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.0 / arduino-builder 1.0.0-beta13) (optional) when set to true , the library will be compiled using a .a (archive) file. First, all source files are compiled into .o files as normal. Then instead of including all .o files in the linker command directly, all .o files are saved into a .a file, which is then included in the linker command. 1.5 format library folder structure is required. includes - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.10) (optional) a comma separated list of files of the library to be added to the sketch as #include <...> lines. This property is used with the \"Include library\" command in the Arduino IDE. If the includes property is missing, all the header files (.h) on the root source folder are included. precompiled - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) enables support for .a (archive) and .so (shared object) files. See the \"Precompiled binaries\" section for documentation of the required location in the library for these files. The static library should be linked as an ldflag. The precompiled field has two supported values, which control how any source files in the library are handled: true - Source files are always compiled. This is useful for \"mixed\" libraries, such as those that contain both open source code and the precompiled binary of a closed source component. Support for \"mixed\" libraries was inadvertently lost in Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0, and returned in Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0. full - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If the library provides a precompiled library for the board being compiled for, the source files will not be compiled.

Boards Manager functionality is provided by Arduino CLI and Arduino IDE . Naming of the JSON index file \u00b6 Many different index files coming from different vendors may be in use, so each vendor should name their own index file in a way that won't conflict with others. The file must be named as follows: package_YOURNAME_PACKAGENAME_index.json The prefix package_ and the postfix _index.json are mandatory (otherwise the index file is not recognised by the Arduino development software) while the choice of YOURNAME_PACKAGENAME is left to the packager. We suggest using a domain name owned by the packager. For example: package_arduino.cc_index.json or package_example.com_avr_boards_index.json The index URL is periodically checked for updates, so expect a constant flow of downloads (proportional to the number of active users). JSON Index file contents \u00b6 The root of the JSON index is an array of packages : { \"packages\" : [ PACKAGE_XXXX ] } 3rd party vendors should use a single PACKAGE_XXXX that is a dictionary map with the vendor's metadata, a list of PLATFORMS and a list of TOOLS . For example: { \"name\" : \"arduino\" , \"maintainer\" : \"Arduino LLC\" , \"websiteURL\" : \"http://www.arduino.cc/\" , \"email\" : \"packages@arduino.cc\" , \"platforms\" : [ PLATFORM_AVR , PLATFORM_ARM , PLATFORM_XXXXX , PLATFORM_YYYYY ], \"tools\" : [ TOOLS_COMPILER_AVR , TOOLS_UPLOADER_AVR , TOOLS_COMPILER_ARM , TOOLS_XXXXXXX , TOOLS_YYYYYYY ] } The metadata fields are: name : the folder used for the installed cores. The vendor folder name of the installed package is determined by this field maintainer : the extended name of the vendor that is displayed on the Arduino IDE Boards Manager GUI websiteURL : the URL to the vendor's website, appears on the Arduino IDE Boards Manager as a \"More info\" link email : the email of the vendor/maintainer Now, before looking at PLATFORMS , let's explore first how TOOLS are made. Tools definitions \u00b6 Each tool describes a binary distribution of a command line tool. A tool can be: a compiler toolchain an uploader a file preprocessor a debugger a program that performs a firmware upgrade a pluggable discovery a pluggable monitor basically anything that can run on the user's host PC and do something useful. For example, Arduino uses two command line tools for the AVR boards: avr-gcc (the compiler) and avrdude (the uploader). Tools are mapped as JSON in this way: { \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7\" , \"systems\" : [ { \"size\" : \"34683056\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:3903553d035da59e33cff9941b857c3cb379cb0638105dfdf69c97f0acc8e7b5\" , \"host\" : \"arm-linux-gnueabihf\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.bz2\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.bz2\" }, { \"size\" : \"38045723\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:03d322b9df6da17289e9e7c6233c34a8535d9c645c19efc772ba19e56914f339\" , \"host\" : \"aarch64-linux-gnu\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-aarch64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-aarch64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" }, { \"size\" : \"36684546\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:f6ed2346953fcf88df223469088633eb86de997fa27ece117fd1ef170d69c1f8\" , \"host\" : \"x86_64-apple-darwin14\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-x86_64-apple-darwin14.tar.bz2\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-x86_64-apple-darwin14.tar.bz2\" }, { \"size\" : \"52519412\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:a54f64755fff4cb792a1495e5defdd789902a2a3503982e81b898299cf39800e\" , \"host\" : \"i686-mingw32\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-i686-w64-mingw32.zip\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-i686-w64-mingw32.zip\" }, { \"size\" : \"37176991\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:954bbffb33545bcdcd473af993da2980bf32e8461ff55a18e0eebc7b2ef69a4c\" , \"host\" : \"i686-linux-gnu\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" }, { \"size\" : \"37630618\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:bd8c37f6952a2130ac9ee32c53f6a660feb79bee8353c8e289eb60fdcefed91e\" , \"host\" : \"x86_64-linux-gnu\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" } ] }, The field name and version are respectively the name and version of the tool. Each tool is uniquely identified by the triple ( packager , name , version ). packager (AKA \"vendor\") is defined by the name value of the tool's package. There can be many different versions of the same tool available at the same time, for example: ( arduino , avr-gcc , 5.4.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino2 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino5 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 7.3.0-atmel3.6.1-arduino7 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 5.11 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.0 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.1 ) ..... Each tool version may come in different build flavours for different OS. Each flavour is listed under the systems array. In the example above avr-gcc comes with builds for: ARM Linux 32-bit ( arm-linux-gnueabihf ), ARM Linux 64-bit ( aarch64-linux-gnu ), macOS 64-bit ( x86_64-apple-darwin14 ), Windows ( i686-mingw32 ), Linux 32-bit ( i686-linux-gnu ), Linux 64-bit ( x86_64-linux-gnu ) The IDE will take care to install the right flavour based on the host value, or fail if a needed flavour is missing. Note that this information is not used to select the toolchain during compilation. If you want this specific version to be used, you should use the notation {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} in the platform.txt. The other fields are: url : the download URL of the tool's archive archiveFileName : the name of the file saved to disk after the download (some web servers don't provide the filename through the HTTP request) size : the size of the archive in bytes checksum : the checksum of the archive, used to check if the file has been corrupted. The format is ALGORITHM:CHECKSUM , currently MD5 , SHA-1 , SHA-256 algorithm are supported, we recommend SHA-256 . On *nix or macOS you can use the command shasum -a 256 filename to generate SHA-256 checksums. There are free options for Windows, including md5deep. There are also online utilities for generating checksums. Platforms definitions \u00b6 Finally, let's see how PLATFORMS are made. { \"name\" : \"Arduino AVR Boards\" , \"architecture\" : \"avr\" , \"version\" : \"1.6.6\" , \"category\" : \"Arduino\" , \"help\" : { \"online\" : \"http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage\" }, \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/cores/avr-1.6.6.tar.bz2\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-1.6.6.tar.bz2\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:08ad5db4978ebea22344edc5d77dce0923d8a644da7a14dc8072e883c76058d8\" , \"size\" : \"4876916\" , \"boards\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Arduino Y\u00fan\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Uno\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Diecimila\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Nano\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Mega\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino MegaADK\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Leonardo\" }, ], \"toolsDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"4.8.1-arduino5\" }, { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avrdude\" , \"version\" : \"6.0.1-arduino5\" } ], \"discoveryDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"serial-discovery\" }, { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"mdns-discovery\" } ], \"monitorDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"serial-monitor\" } ] }, Each PLATFORM describes a core for a specific architecture. The fields needed are: name : the extended name of the platform that is displayed on the Boards Manager GUI architecture : is the architecture of the platform (avr, sam, etc...). It must match the architecture of the core as explained in the Arduino platform specification version : the version of the platform. deprecated : (optional) setting to true causes the platform to be moved to the bottom of all Boards Manager and arduino-cli core listings and marked \"DEPRECATED\". category : this field is reserved, a 3rd party core must set it to Contributed help / online : is a URL that is displayed on the Arduino IDE's Boards Manager as an \"Online Help\" link url , archiveFileName , size and checksum : metadata of the core archive file. The meaning is the same as for the TOOLS boards : the list of boards supported (note: just the names to display on the Arduino IDE's Boards Manager GUI! the real boards definitions are inside boards.txt inside the core archive file) toolsDependencies : the tools needed by this platform. They will be installed by Boards Manager along with the platform. Each tool is referenced by the triple ( packager , name , version ) as previously said. Note that you can reference tools available in other packages as well, even if no platform of that package is installed. discoveryDependencies : the Pluggable Discoveries needed by this platform. These are tools , defined exactly like the ones referenced in toolsDependencies . Unlike toolsDependencies , discoveries are referenced by the pair ( packager , name ). The version is not specified because the latest installed discovery tool will always be used. Like toolsDependencies they will be installed by Boards Manager along with the platform and can reference tools available in other packages as well, even if no platform of that package is installed. monitorDependencies : the Pluggable Monitors needed by this platform. These are tools , defined exactly like the ones referenced in toolsDependencies . Unlike toolsDependencies , monitors are referenced by the pair ( packager , name ). The version is not specified because the latest installed monitor tool will always be used. Like toolsDependencies they will be installed by Boards Manager along with the platform and can reference tools available in other packages as well, even if no platform of that package is installed. The version field is validated by both Arduino IDE and JSemVer . Here are the rules Arduino IDE follows for parsing versions ( source ): Split the version at the - character and continue with the first part. If there are no dots ( . ), parse version as an integer and form a Version from that integer using Version.forIntegers If there is one dot, split version into two, parse each part as an integer, and form a Version from those integers using Version.forIntegers Otherwise, simply parse version into a Version using Version.valueOf Note: if you miss a bracket in the JSON index, then add the URL to your Preferences, and open Boards Manager it can cause the Arduino IDE to no longer load until you have deleted the file from your arduino15 folder. How a tool's path is determined in platform.txt \u00b6 When the IDE needs a tool, it downloads the corresponding archive file and unpacks the content into a private folder that can be referenced from platform.txt using one of the following properties: {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME.path} For example, to obtain the avr-gcc 4.8.1 folder we can use {runtime.tools.avr-gcc-4.8.1.path} or {runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path} . In general the same tool may be provided by different packagers (for example the Arduino packager may provide an arduino:avr-gcc and another 3rd party packager may provide their own 3rdparty:avr-gcc ). The rules to disambiguate are as follows: The property {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME.path} points, in order of priority, to: the tool, version and packager specified via toolsDependencies in the package_index.json the highest version of the tool provided by the packager of the current platform the highest version of the tool provided by the packager of the referenced platform used for compile (see \"Referencing another core, variant or tool\" for more info) the highest version of the tool provided by any other packager (in case of tie, the first packager in alphabetical order wins) The property {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} points, in order of priority, to: the tool and version provided by the packager of the current platform the tool and version provided by the packager of the referenced platform used for compile (see \"Referencing another core, variant or tool\" for more info) the tool and version provided by any other packager (in case of tie, the first packager in alphabetical order wins) Example JSON index file \u00b6 { \"packages\" : [ { \"name\" : \"myboard\" , \"maintainer\" : \"Jane Developer\" , \"websiteURL\" : \"https://github.com/janedeveloper/myboard\" , \"email\" : \"jane@janedeveloper.org\" , \"help\" : { \"online\" : \"http://janedeveloper.org/forum/myboard\" }, \"platforms\" : [ { \"name\" : \"My Board\" , \"architecture\" : \"avr\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.0\" , \"category\" : \"Contributed\" , \"help\" : { \"online\" : \"http://janedeveloper.org/forum/myboard\" }, \"url\" : \"https://janedeveloper.github.io/myboard/myboard-1.0.0.zip\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"myboard-1.0.0.zip\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:ec3ff8a1dc96d3ba6f432b9b837a35fd4174a34b3d2927de1d51010e8b94f9f1\" , \"size\" : \"15005\" , \"boards\" : [{ \"name\" : \"My Board\" }, { \"name\" : \"My Board Pro\" }], \"toolsDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"4.8.1-arduino5\" }, { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avrdude\" , \"version\" : \"6.0.1-arduino5\" } ] }, { \"name\" : \"My Board\" , \"architecture\" : \"avr\" , \"version\" : \"1.0.1\" , \"category\" : \"Contributed\" , \"help\" : { \"online\" : \"http://janedeveloper.org/forum/myboard\" }, \"url\" : \"https://janedeveloper.github.io/myboard/myboard-1.0.1.zip\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"myboard-1.0.1.zip\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:9c86ee28a7ce9fe33e8b07ec643316131e0031b0d22e63bb398902a5fdadbca9\" , \"size\" : \"15125\" , \"boards\" : [{ \"name\" : \"My Board\" }, { \"name\" : \"My Board Pro\" }], \"toolsDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"4.8.1-arduino5\" }, { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avrdude\" , \"version\" : \"6.0.1-arduino5\" } ] } ], \"tools\" : [] } ] } In the example there is one PACKAGE , My Board.

You must remove the architecture folder(e.g., avr or arm ), moving all the files and folders within the architecture folder up a level. Installation \u00b6 The installation archives contain the Board support files. Supported formats are .zip , .tar.bz2 , and .tar.gz . Starting from Arduino CLI >=0.30.0 support for .tar.xz , and .tar.zst has been added, by the way, if you want to keep compatibility with older versions of Arduino IDE and Arduino CLI we recommend using one of the older formats. The folder structure of the core archive is slightly different from the standard manually installed Arduino IDE 1.5+ compatible hardware folder structure. You must remove the architecture folder(e.g., avr or arm ), moving all the files and folders within the architecture folder up a level.

The version field is validated by both Arduino IDE and JSemVer . Here are the rules Arduino IDE follows for parsing versions ( source ): Split the version at the - character and continue with the first part. If there are no dots ( . ), parse version as an integer and form a Version from that integer using Version.forIntegers If there is one dot, split version into two, parse each part as an integer, and form a Version from those integers using Version.forIntegers Otherwise, simply parse version into a Version using Version.valueOf Note: if you miss a bracket in the JSON index, then add the URL to your Preferences, and open Boards Manager it can cause the Arduino IDE to no longer load until you have deleted the file from your arduino15 folder.","title":"Platforms definitions"},{"location":"package_index_json-specification/#how-a-tools-path-is-determined-in-platformtxt","text":"When the IDE needs a tool, it downloads the corresponding archive file and unpacks the content into a private folder that can be referenced from platform.txt using one of the following properties: {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME.path} For example, to obtain the avr-gcc 4.8.1 folder we can use {runtime.tools.avr-gcc-4.8.1.path} or {runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path} .

Platforms add support for new boards to the Arduino development software. They are installable either via Boards Manager or manual installation to the hardware folder of Arduino's sketchbook folder (AKA \"user directory\"). A platform may consist of as little as a single configuration file. Hardware Folders structure \u00b6 The new hardware folders have a hierarchical structure organized in two levels: the first level is the vendor/maintainer the second level is the supported architecture A vendor/maintainer can have multiple supported architectures. For example, below we have three hardware vendors called \"arduino\", \"yyyyy\" and \"xxxxx\": hardware/arduino/avr/... - Arduino - AVR Boards hardware/arduino/sam/... - Arduino - SAM (32bit ARM) Boards hardware/yyyyy/avr/... - Yyy - AVR hardware/xxxxx/avr/... - Xxx - AVR The vendor \"arduino\" has two supported architectures (AVR and SAM), while \"xxxxx\" and \"yyyyy\" have only AVR. Architecture values are case sensitive (e.g. AVR != avr ). If possible, follow existing architecture name conventions when creating hardware packages. Use the vendor folder name to differentiate your package. The architecture folder name is used to determine library compatibility and to permit referencing resources from another core of the same architecture, so use of a non-standard architecture name can have a harmful effect. Architecture configurations \u00b6 Each architecture must be configured through a set of configuration files: platform.txt contains definitions for the CPU architecture used (compiler, build process parameters, tools used for upload, etc.) boards.txt contains definitions for the boards (board name, parameters for building and uploading sketches, etc.) programmers.txt contains definitions for external programmers (typically used to burn bootloaders or sketches on a blank CPU/board) Configuration files format \u00b6 A configuration file is a list of \"key=value\" properties. The value of a property can be expressed using the value of another property by putting its name inside brackets \"{\" \"}\". For example: compiler.path=/tools/g++_arm_none_eabi/bin/ compiler.c.cmd=arm-none-eabi-gcc [....] recipe.c.o.pattern={compiler.path}{compiler.c.cmd} In this example the property recipe.c.o.pattern will be set to /tools/g++_arm_none_eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc , which is the composition of the properties compiler.path and compiler.c.cmd . Comments \u00b6 Lines starting with # are treated as comments and will be ignored. # Like in this example # -------------------- # I'm a comment! Automatic property override for specific OS \u00b6 We can specify an OS-specific value for a property. For example the following file: tools.bossac.cmd=bossac tools.bossac.cmd.windows=bossac.exe will set the property tools.bossac.cmd to the value bossac on Linux and macOS and bossac.exe on Windows. Supported suffixes are .linux , .windows and .macosx . Global Predefined properties \u00b6 The following automatically generated properties can be used globally in all configuration files: {runtime.platform.path} : the absolute path of the board platform folder (i.e. the folder containing boards.txt) {runtime.hardware.path} : the absolute path of the hardware folder (i.e. the folder containing the board platform folder) {runtime.ide.path} : the absolute path of the Arduino IDE or Arduino CLI folder {runtime.ide.version} : the version number of the Arduino IDE as a number (this uses two digits per version number component, and removes the points and leading zeroes, so Arduino IDE 1.8.3 becomes 01.08.03 which becomes runtime.ide.version=10803 ). When using Arduino development software other than the Arduino IDE, this is set to a meaningless version number. {ide_version} : Compatibility alias for {runtime.ide.version} {runtime.os} : the running OS (\"linux\", \"windows\", \"macosx\") {software} : set to \"ARDUINO\" {name} : platform vendor name {_id} : board ID of the board being compiled for {build.fqbn} : the FQBN (fully qualified board name) of the board being compiled for. The FQBN follows the format: VENDOR:ARCHITECTURE:BOARD_ID[:MENU_ID=OPTION_ID[,MENU2_ID=OPTION_ID ...]] {build.source.path} : Path to the sketch being compiled. If the sketch is in an unsaved state, it will the path of its temporary folder. {build.library_discovery_phase} : set to 1 during library discovery and to 0 during normal build. A macro defined with this property can be used to disable the inclusion of heavyweight headers during discovery to reduce compilation time. This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.8.14/Arduino Builder 1.6.0/Arduino CLI 0.12.0. Note: with the same intent, -DARDUINO_LIB_DISCOVERY_PHASE was added to recipe.preproc.macros during library discovery in Arduino Builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.10.0. That flag was replaced by the more flexible {build.library_discovery_phase} property. {compiler.optimization_flags} : see \"Sketch debugging configuration\" for details {extra.time.utc} : Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) according to the machine the build is running on {extra.time.local} : Unix time with local timezone and DST offset {extra.time.zone} : local timezone offset without the DST component {extra.time.dst} : local daylight savings time offset Compatibility note: Versions before Arduino IDE 1.6.0 only used one digit per version number component in {runtime.ide.version} (so 1.5.9 was 159 , not 10509 ). platform.txt \u00b6 The platform.txt file contains information about a platform's specific aspects (compilers command line flags, paths, system libraries, etc.). The following meta-data must be defined: name=Arduino AVR Boards version=1.5.3 The name will be shown as the Arduino IDE's Board menu section title or the Name field of arduino-cli core list 's output for the platform. The version is currently unused, it is reserved for future use (probably together with the Boards Manager to handle dependencies on cores). Build process \u00b6 The platform.txt file is used to configure the build process . This is done through a list of recipes . Each recipe is a command line expression that explains how to call the compiler (or other tools) for every build step and which parameter should be passed. The Arduino development software, before starting the build, determines the list of files to compile. The list is composed of: the user's Sketch source code in the selected board's Core source code in the Libraries used in the sketch A temporary folder is created to store the build artifacts whose path is available through the global property {build.path} . A property {build.project_name} with the name of the project and a property {build.arch} with the name of the architecture is set as well. {build.path} : The path to the temporary folder to store build artifacts {build.project_name} : The project name {build.arch} : The MCU architecture (avr, sam, etc...) There are some other {build.xxx} properties available, that are explained in the boards.txt section of this guide. Security credential properties \u00b6 Some of them allow specifying trusted security credentials (signing and encryption keys) that can be used by a \"secure boot\" system : build.keys.keychain : for the directory containing the keys build.keys.sign_key : for the signing key build.keys.encrypt_key : for the encryption key If any of these properties are defined, the others are required. These properties can be overwritten respectively with --keys-keychain , --sign-key , --encrypt-key compile flags in the Arduino CLI. Recipes to compile source code \u00b6 We said that the Arduino development software determines a list of files to compile. Each file can be source code written in C (.c files), C++ (.cpp files) or Assembly (.S files). Every language is compiled using its respective recipe : recipe.c.o.pattern : for C files recipe.cpp.o.pattern : for CPP files recipe.S.o.pattern : for Assembly files The recipes can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties (for each file compiled): {includes} : the list of include paths in the format \"-I/include/path -I/another/path....\" {source_file} : the path to the source file {object_file} : the path to the output file For example the following is used for AVR: ## Compiler global definitions compiler.path={runtime.ide.path}/tools/avr/bin/ compiler.c.cmd=avr-gcc compiler.c.flags=-c -g -Os -w -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -MMD [......] ## Compile c files recipe.c.o.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.c.cmd}\" {compiler.c.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -DF_CPU={build.f_cpu} -DARDUINO={runtime.ide.version} -DARDUINO_{build.board} -DARDUINO_ARCH_{build.arch} {build.extra_flags} {includes} \"{source_file}\" -o \"{object_file}\" Note that some properties, like {build.mcu} for example, are taken from the boards.txt file which is documented later in this specification. Recipes to build the core.a archive file \u00b6 The core of the selected board is compiled as described in the previous paragraph, but the object files obtained from the compile are also archived into a static library named core.a using the recipe.ar.pattern . The recipe can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {object_file} : the object file to include in the archive {archive_file_path} : fully qualified archive file (ex. \"/path/to/core.a\"). This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.6.6/arduino builder 1.0.0-beta12 as a replacement for {build.path}/{archive_file} . {archive_file} : the name of the resulting archive (ex. \"core.a\") For example, Arduino provides the following for AVR: compiler.ar.cmd=avr-ar compiler.ar.flags=rcs [......] ## Create archives recipe.ar.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.ar.cmd}\" {compiler.ar.flags} \"{archive_file_path}\" \"{object_file}\" Recipes for linking \u00b6 All the artifacts produced by the previous steps (sketch object files, libraries object files and core.a archive) are linked together using the recipe.c.combine.pattern . The recipe can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {object_files} : the list of object files to include in the archive (\"file1.o file2.o ....\") {archive_file_path} : fully qualified archive file (ex. \"/path/to/core.a\"). This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.6.6/arduino builder 1.0.0-beta12 as a replacement for {build.path}/{archive_file} . {archive_file} : the name of the core archive file (ex. \"core.a\") {compiler.libraries.ldflags} : the linking flags for precompiled libraries, which consist of automatically generated -L flags for the library path and -l flags for library files, as well as any custom flags provided via the ldflags field of library.properties. In order to support precompiled libraries, platform.txt must contain a definition of compiler.libraries.ldflags , to which any automatically generated flags will be appended. Support for precompiled libraries was added in Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0. For example the following is used for AVR: compiler.c.elf.flags=-Os -Wl,--gc-sections compiler.c.elf.cmd=avr-gcc compiler.libraries.ldflags= [......] ## Combine gc-sections, archives, and objects recipe.c.combine.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.c.elf.cmd}\" {compiler.c.elf.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -o \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" {object_files} {compiler.libraries.ldflags} \"{archive_file_path}\" \"-L{build.path}\" -lm Recipes for extraction of executable files and other binary data \u00b6 An arbitrary number of extra steps can be performed at the end of objects linking. These steps can be used to extract binary data used for upload and they are defined by a set of recipes with the following format: recipe.objcopy.FILE_EXTENSION_1.pattern=[.....] recipe.objcopy.FILE_EXTENSION_2.pattern=[.....] [.....] FILE_EXTENSION_x must be replaced with the extension of the extracted file, for example the AVR platform needs two files a .hex and a .eep , so we made two recipes like: recipe.objcopy.eep.pattern=[.....] recipe.objcopy.hex.pattern=[.....] There are no specific properties set by the Arduino development software here. A full example for the AVR platform can be: ## Create eeprom recipe.objcopy.eep.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.objcopy.cmd}\" {compiler.objcopy.eep.flags} \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.eep\" ## Create hex recipe.objcopy.hex.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.elf2hex.cmd}\" {compiler.elf2hex.flags} \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex\" Recipes to compute binary sketch size \u00b6 At the end of the build the Arduino development software shows the final binary sketch size to the user. The size is calculated using the recipe recipe.size.pattern . The output of the command executed using the recipe is parsed through the regular expressions set in the properties: recipe.size.regex : Program storage space used. recipe.size.regex.data : Dynamic memory used by global variables. For AVR we have: compiler.size.cmd=avr-size [....] ## Compute size recipe.size.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.size.cmd}\" -A \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex\" recipe.size.regex=^(?:\\.text|\\.data|\\.bootloader)\\s+([0-9]+).* recipe.size.regex.data=^(?:\\.data|\\.bss|\\.noinit)\\s+([0-9]+).* Two properties can be used to define the total available memory: {upload.maximum_size} : available program storage space {upload.maximum_data_size} : available dynamic memory for global variables If the binary sketch size exceeds the value of these properties, the compilation process fails. This information is displayed in the console output after compiling a sketch, along with the relative memory usage value: Sketch uses 924 bytes (2%) of program storage space. Maximum is 32256 bytes. Global variables use 9 bytes (0%) of dynamic memory, leaving 2039 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 2048 bytes. Recipes to compute binary sketch size for more complex systems (since Arduino CLI >=0.21.0) \u00b6 A platform may provide a tool for the specific purpose to analyze the binaries and compute the sketch size and memory usage statistics. This is especially useful for boards with non-trivial memory layouts where the classic reg-exp based approach is not sufficient. The command line to run is specified with the recipe recipe.advanced_size.pattern . The expected output from the tool is a JSON object with the following format: { \"output\" : \"Your sketch uses 2200 bytes of program memory out of 8192 (27%)\\nThe static RAM used is 200 bytes (of 2048 max)\" , \"severity\" : \"info\" , \"sections\" : [ { \"name\" : \"text\" , \"size\" : 2200 , \"max_size\" : 8192 }, { \"name\" : \"data\" , \"size\" : 200 , \"max_size\" : 2048 } ] } The meaning of the fields is the following: output : is a preformatted text that is displayed as-is in console. severity : indicates the warning level of the output messages, it must be info , warning or error . Warnings and errors are displayed in red (or in a different color than normal output). Errors will make the build/upload fail. sections : is an array containing the memory sections and their usage level. This array is used to report memory usage in a machine-readable format if requested by the user. Each item represents a memory section and may contain the following fields name : an identifier for the section size : the sketch size for the section max_size : the maximum size for the section When the severity is set to error the build/upload is interrupted and an exception is returned to the calling process. In this case an extra exception message must be provided through the error field, for example: { \"output\" : \"Your sketch uses 12200 bytes of program memory out of 8192 (149%))\\nThe static RAM used is 200 bytes (of 2048 max)\" , \"severity\" : \"error\" , \"error\" : \"Sketch is too big!\" , \"sections\" : [ { \"name\" : \"text\" , \"size\" : 12200 , \"max_size\" : 8192 }, { \"name\" : \"data\" , \"size\" : 200 , \"max_size\" : 2048 } ] } This means that the sections part is NOT used to automatically check if the sketch size exceeds the available memory: this check is now delegated to the tool that must report a \"severity\":\"error\" with a meaningful error message. If both recipe.size.pattern and recipe.advanced_size.pattern are present then recipe.advanced_size.pattern will be used. Since the recipe.advanced_size.pattern feature is available starting from Arduino CLI>=0.21.0, to maximize backward compatibility, we recommend to provide both recipe.size.pattern and recipe.advanced_size.pattern if possible, so the old versions of the IDE/CLI will continue to work (even with a less detailed memory usage report). Recipes to export compiled binary \u00b6 When you do a Sketch > Export compiled Binary in the Arduino IDE, the compiled binary is copied from the build folder to the sketch folder. Two binaries are copied; the standard binary, and a binary that has been merged with the bootloader file (identified by the .with_bootloader in the filename). Two recipes affect how Export compiled Binary works: recipe.output.tmp_file : Defines the binary's filename in the build folder. recipe.output.save_file : Defines the filename to use when copying the binary file to the sketch folder. As with other processes, there are pre and post build hooks for Export compiled Binary . The recipe.hooks.savehex.presavehex.NUMBER.pattern and recipe.hooks.savehex.postsavehex.NUMBER.pattern hooks (but not recipe.output.tmp_file and recipe.output.save_file ) can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {sketch_path} : the absolute path of the sketch folder Recipe to run the preprocessor \u00b6 For detecting which libraries to include in the build, and for generating function prototypes, (just) the preprocessor is run. For this, the recipe.preproc.macros recipe exists. This recipe must run the preprocessor on a given source file, writing the preprocessed output to a given output file, and generate (only) preprocessor errors on standard output. This preprocessor run should happen with the same defines and other preprocessor-influencing-options as for normally compiling the source files. The recipes can be built concatenating other automatically generated properties (for each file compiled): {includes} : the list of include paths in the format \"-I/include/path -I/another/path....\" {source_file} : the path to the source file {preprocessed_file_path} : the path to the output file For example the following is used for AVR: preproc.macros.flags=-w -x c++ -E -CC recipe.preproc.macros=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.cpp.cmd}\" {compiler.cpp.flags} {preproc.macros.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -DF_CPU={build.f_cpu} -DARDUINO={runtime.ide.version} -DARDUINO_{build.board} -DARDUINO_ARCH_{build.arch} {compiler.cpp.extra_flags} {build.extra_flags} {includes} \"{source_file}\" -o \"{preprocessed_file_path}\" Note that the {preprocessed_file_path} might point to (your operating system's equivalent) of /dev/null . In this case, also passing -MMD to gcc is problematic, as it will try to generate a dependency file called /dev/null.d , which will usually result in a permission error. Since platforms typically include {compiler.cpp.flags} here, which includes -MMD , the -MMD option is automatically filtered out of the recipe.preproc.macros recipe to prevent this error. If recipe.preproc.macros is not defined, it is automatically generated from recipe.cpp.o.pattern . Note that older Arduino IDE versions used the recipe.preproc.includes recipe (which is not documented here) to determine includes. Since Arduino IDE 1.6.7 (arduino-builder 1.2.0) this was changed and recipe.preproc.includes is no longer used. Pre and post build hooks (since Arduino IDE 1.6.5) \u00b6 You can specify pre and post actions around each recipe. These are called \"hooks\". Here is the complete list of available hooks: recipe.hooks.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before sketch preprocessing and libraries discovery) recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before sketch compilation) recipe.hooks.sketch.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after sketch compilation) recipe.hooks.libraries.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before libraries compilation) recipe.hooks.libraries.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after libraries compilation) recipe.hooks.core.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before core compilation) recipe.hooks.core.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after core compilation) recipe.hooks.linking.prelink.NUMBER.pattern (called before linking) recipe.hooks.linking.postlink.NUMBER.pattern (called after linking) recipe.hooks.objcopy.preobjcopy.NUMBER.pattern (called before objcopy recipes execution) recipe.hooks.objcopy.postobjcopy.NUMBER.pattern (called after objcopy recipes execution) recipe.hooks.savehex.presavehex.NUMBER.pattern (called before savehex recipe execution) recipe.hooks.savehex.postsavehex.NUMBER.pattern (called after savehex recipe execution) Example: you want to execute two commands before sketch compilation and one after linking. You'll add to your platform.txt: recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=echo sketch compilation started at recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.2.pattern=date recipe.hooks.linking.postlink.1.pattern=echo linking is complete Warning: hooks recipes are sorted before execution. If you need to write more than 10 recipes for a single hook, pad the number with a zero, for example: recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.01.pattern=echo 1 recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.02.pattern=echo 2 ... recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.11.pattern=echo 11 Note: all the pre* hooks are executed while producing the \"compilation database\" (a JSON file with the list of commands to run to compile the sketch), but the post* hooks and all compile commands are skipped. See the arduino-cli compile command reference for more info. Global platform.txt \u00b6 Properties defined in a platform.txt created in the hardware subfolder of the Arduino IDE installation folder will be used for all platforms and will override local properties. This feature is currently only available when using the Arduino IDE. platform.local.txt \u00b6 Introduced in Arduino IDE 1.5.7. This file can be used to override properties defined in platform.txt or define new properties without modifying platform.txt (e.g. when platform.txt is tracked by a version control system). It must be placed in the same folder as the platform.txt it supplements. boards.txt \u00b6 This file contains definitions and metadata for the boards supported by the platform. Boards are referenced by their short name, the board ID. The settings for a board are defined through a set of properties with keys having the board ID as prefix. For example, the board ID chosen for the Arduino Uno board is \"uno\". An extract of the Uno board configuration in boards.txt looks like: [......] uno.name=Arduino Uno uno.build.mcu=atmega328p uno.build.f_cpu=16000000L uno.build.board=AVR_UNO uno.build.core=arduino uno.build.variant=standard [......] Note that all the relevant keys start with the board ID uno.xxxxx . The uno.name property contains the human-friendly name of the board. This is shown in the Board menu of the IDEs, the \"Board Name\" field of Arduino CLI's text output, or the \"name\" key of Arduino CLI's JSON output. The uno.build.board property is used to set a compile-time macro ARDUINO_{build.board} to allow use of conditional code between #ifdef s. If not defined, a build.board value is automatically generated and the Arduino development software outputs a warning. In this case the macro defined at compile time will be ARDUINO_AVR_UNO . The other properties will override the corresponding global properties when the user selects the board. These properties will be globally available, in other configuration files too, without the board ID prefix: uno.build.mcu => build.mcu uno.build.f_cpu => build.f_cpu uno.build.board => build.board uno.build.core => build.core uno.build.variant => build.variant This explains the presence of {build.mcu} or {build.board} in the platform.txt recipes: their value is overwritten respectively by {uno.build.mcu} and {uno.build.board} when the Uno board is selected! Moreover the following properties are automatically generated: {build.core.path} : The path to the selected board's core folder (inside the core platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/core/arduino) {build.system.path} : The path to the core platform 's system folder if available (for example hardware/arduino/sam/system) {build.variant.path} : The path to the selected board variant folder (inside the variant platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/variants/micro) If the platform supports pluggable discovery it may also declare a set of upload_port.* properties, these properties will be used to identify a board by the discovery process when plugged in. For example we could declare a series of upload_port.vid and upload_port.pid properties for the Uno like so: uno.upload_port.vid.0=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.0=0x0043 uno.upload_port.vid.1=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.1=0x0001 uno.upload_port.vid.2=0x2A03 uno.upload_port.pid.2=0x0043 uno.upload_port.vid.3=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.3=0x0243 In this case we're using the board's USB VID/PID pair to identify it but upload_port.* properties can be anything that can help identify a certain board. For more detailed information see the board identification section of the pluggable discovery documentation. Cores \u00b6 Cores are placed inside the cores subfolder. Many different cores can be provided within a single platform. For example the following could be a valid platform layout: hardware/arduino/avr/cores/ : Cores folder for \"avr\" architecture, package \"arduino\" hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino : the Arduino Core hardware/arduino/avr/cores/rtos : a hypothetical RTOS Core The board's property build.core is used to find the core that must be compiled and linked when the board is selected. For example if a board needs the Arduino core the build.core variable should be set to: uno.build.core=arduino or if the RTOS core is needed, to: uno.build.core=rtos In any case the contents of the selected core folder are compiled and the core folder path is added to the include files search path. ArduinoCore-API \u00b6 Although much of the implementation of a core is architecture-specific, the standardized core API and the hardware independent components should be the same for every Arduino platform. In order to free platform authors from the burden of individually maintaining duplicates of this common code, Arduino has published it in a dedicated repository from which it may easily be shared by all platforms. In addition to significantly reducing the effort required to write and maintain a core, ArduinoCore-API assists core authors in providing the unprecedented level of portability between platforms that is a hallmark of the Arduino project. See the arduino/ArduinoCore-API repository for more information. Core Variants \u00b6 Sometimes a board needs some tweaking on the default core configuration (different pin mapping is a typical example). A core variant folder is an additional folder that is compiled together with the core and allows platform developers to easily add specific configurations. Variants must be placed inside the variants folder in the current architecture. For example, Arduino AVR Boards uses: hardware/arduino/avr/cores : Core folder for \"avr\" architecture, \"arduino\" package hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino : The Arduino core hardware/arduino/avr/variants/ : Variant folder for \"avr\" architecture, \"arduino\" package hardware/arduino/avr/variants/standard : ATmega328 based variants hardware/arduino/avr/variants/leonardo : ATmega32U4 based variants In this example, the Arduino Uno board needs the standard variant so the build.variant property is set to standard : [.....] uno.build.core=arduino uno.build.variant=standard [.....] instead, the Arduino Leonardo board needs the leonardo variant: [.....] leonardo.build.core=arduino leonardo.build.variant=leonardo [.....] In the example above, both Uno and Leonardo share the same core but use different variants. In any case, the contents of the selected variant folder path is added to the include search path and its contents are compiled and linked with the sketch. The parameter build.variant.path is automatically generated. Board VID/PID \u00b6 USB vendor IDs (VID) and product IDs (PID) identify USB devices to the computer. If the board uses a unique VID/PID pair, it may be defined in boards.txt: uno.vid.0=0x2341 uno.pid.0=0x0043 uno.vid.1=0x2341 uno.pid.1=0x0001 The vid and pid properties end with an arbitrary number, which allows multiple VID/PID pairs to be defined for a board. The snippet above is defining the 2341:0043 and 2341:0001 pairs used by Uno boards. The Arduino development software uses the vid and pid properties to automatically identify the boards connected to the computer. This convenience feature isn't available for boards that don't present a unique VID/PID pair. Serial Monitor control signal configuration \u00b6 Arduino boards that use a USB to TTL serial adapter chip for communication with the computer (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega) often utilize the DTR (data terminal ready) or RTS (request to send) serial control signals as a mechanism for the Arduino development software to trigger a reset of the primary microcontroller. The adapter's DTR and RTS pins are set LOW when the control signals are asserted by the computer and this LOW level is converted into a pulse on the microcontroller's reset pin by an \"auto-reset\" circuit on the board. The auto-reset system is necessary to activate the bootloader at the start of an upload. This system is also used to reset the microcontroller when Serial Monitor is started. The reset is convenient because it allows viewing all serial output from the time the program starts. In case the reset caused by opening Serial Monitor is not desirable, the control signal assertion behavior of Serial Monitor is configurable via the serial.disableDTR and serial.disableRTS properties. Setting these properties to true will prevent Serial Monitor from asserting the control signals when that board is selected: [.....] uno.serial.disableDTR=true uno.serial.disableRTS=true [.....] Hiding boards \u00b6 Adding a hide property to a board definition causes it to not be shown in the Arduino IDE's Tools > Board menu. uno.hide= The value of the property is ignored; it's the presence or absence of the property that controls the board's visibility. programmers.txt \u00b6 This file contains definitions for external programmers. These programmers are used by: The Tools > Burn Bootloader feature of the IDEs and arduino-cli burn-bootloader The Sketch > Upload Using Programmer feature of the IDEs and arduino-cli upload --programmer <programmer ID> programmers.txt works similarly to boards.txt . Programmers are referenced by their short name: the programmer ID. The settings for a programmer are defined through a set of properties with keys that use the programmer ID as prefix. For example, the programmer ID chosen for the \"Arduino as ISP\" programmer is \"arduinoasisp\". The definition of this programmer in programmers.txt looks like: [......] arduinoasisp.name=Arduino as ISP arduinoasisp.protocol=stk500v1 arduinoasisp.program.speed=19200 arduinoasisp.program.tool=avrdude arduinoasisp.program.extra_params=-P{serial.port} -b{program.speed} [......] These properties can only be used in the recipes of the actions that use the programmer ( erase , bootloader , and program ). The arduinoasisp.name property defines the human-friendly name of the programmer. This is shown in the Tools > Programmer menu of the IDEs and the output of arduino-cli upload --programmer list and arduino-cli burn-bootloader --programmer list . In Arduino IDE 1.8.12 and older, all programmers of all installed platforms were made available for use. Starting with Arduino IDE 1.8.13 (and in all relevant versions of other Arduino development tools), only the programmers defined by the board and core platform of the currently selected board are available. For this reason, platforms may now need to define copies of the programmers that were previously assumed to be provided by another platform. Tools \u00b6 The Arduino development software uses external command line tools to upload the compiled sketch to the board or to burn bootloaders using external programmers. For example, avrdude is used for AVR based boards and bossac for SAM based boards, but there is no limit, any command line executable can be used. The command line parameters are specified using recipes in the same way used for platform build process. Tools are configured inside the platform.txt file. Every Tool is identified by a short name, the Tool ID. A tool can be used for different purposes: upload a sketch to the target board (using a bootloader preinstalled on the board) program a sketch to the target board using an external programmer erase the target board's flash memory using an external programmer burn a bootloader into the target board using an external programmer Each action has its own recipe and its configuration is done through a set of properties having key starting with tools prefix followed by the tool ID and the action: [....] tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.program.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.erase.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.bootloader.pattern=[......] [.....] A tool may have some actions not defined (it's not mandatory to define all four actions). Let's look at how the upload action is defined for avrdude: tools.avrdude.path={runtime.tools.avrdude.path} tools.avrdude.cmd.path={path}/bin/avrdude tools.avrdude.config.path={path}/etc/avrdude.conf tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.port.protocol} -P{upload.port.address} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" The tool configuration properties are available globally without the prefix. For example, the tools.avrdude.cmd.path property can be used as {cmd.path} inside the recipe, and the same happens for all the other avrdude configuration variables. How to retrieve tools path via {runtime.tools.*} properties \u00b6 A {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME.path} and {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-TOOLVERSION.path} property is generated for the tools provided by the current platform and for any other platform installed via Boards Manager. See {runtime.tools.*.path} rules for details on how the runtime properties are determined. Environment variables \u00b6 All the tools launched to compile or upload a sketch will have the following environment variable set: ARDUINO_USER_AGENT : contains the name and version of the client used by the user in HTTP user-agent format , for example \"arduino-cli/0.21.0\" . It may also contain multiple space-delimited entries like \"arduino-cli/0.21.0 ArduinoIDE/2.0.0-rc1\" if this information is available. Pluggable discovery \u00b6 Discovery tools are a special kind of tool used to find supported boards. A platform must declare one or more Pluggable Discoveries in its platform.txt . Discoveries can be referenced from other packages, including the builtin dummy package which contains the traditional discoveries. There are two different syntaxes to declare discoveries. If the platform uses just one discovery: pluggable_discovery.required=VENDOR_ID:DISCOVERY_NAME instead if it needs multiple discoveries: pluggable_discovery.required.0=VENDOR_ID:DISCOVERY_0_NAME pluggable_discovery.required.1=VENDOR_ID:DISCOVERY_1_NAME A platform that supports only boards connected via serial ports can easily use the builtin package's serial-discovery without creating a custom pluggable discovery: pluggable_discovery.required=builtin:serial-discovery if it also supports boards connected via the network, it can use the builtin package's mdns-discovery : pluggable_discovery.required.0=builtin:serial-discovery pluggable_discovery.required.1=builtin:mdns-discovery Since the above syntax requires specifying a discovery via the discoveryDependencies field of the platform's package index , it might be cumbersome to use with manual installations. So we provide another syntax to ease development and beta testing: pluggable_discovery.DISCOVERY_ID.pattern=DISCOVERY_RECIPE DISCOVERY_ID must be replaced by a unique identifier for the particular discovery and DISCOVERY_RECIPE must be replaced by the command line to launch the discovery. An example could be: ## Teensy Ports Discovery pluggable_discovery.teensy.pattern=\"{runtime.tools.teensy_ports.path}/hardware/tools/teensy_ports\" -J2 We strongly recommend using this syntax only for development purposes and not on released platforms. For backward compatibility, if a platform does not declare any discovery (using the pluggable_discovery.* properties in platform.txt ) it will automatically inherit builtin:serial-discovery and builtin:mdns-discovery (but not other builtin discoveries that may be possibly added in the future). For detailed information, see the Pluggable Discovery specification . Pluggable monitor \u00b6 Monitor tools are a special kind of tool used to let the user communicate with the supported boards. A platform must declare one or more Pluggable Monitor in its platform.txt and bind them to a specific port protocol. Monitors can be referenced from other packages. The following directive is used to bind a specific monitor tool to a specific port protocol: pluggable_monitor.required.PROTOCOL=VENDOR_ID:MONITOR_NAME where PROTOCOL must be replaced with the port protocol identifier and VENDOR_ID:MONITOR_NAME must be replaced with the monitor tool identifier. The platform can support as many protocols as needed: pluggable_monitor.required.PROTOCOL1=VENDOR_ID:MONITOR_NAME1 pluggable_monitor.required.PROTOCOL2=VENDOR_ID:MONITOR_NAME2 ... The above syntax requires specifying a monitor tool via the monitorDependencies field of the platform's package index . Since it might be cumbersome to use with manual installations, we provide another syntax to ease development and beta testing: pluggable_monitor.pattern.PROTOCOL=MONITOR_RECIPE where MONITOR_RECIPE must be replaced by the command line to launch the monitor tool for the specific PROTOCOL . An example could be: pluggable_monitor.pattern.custom-ble=\"{runtime.tools.my-ble-monitor.path}/my-ble-monitor\" -H in this case the platform provides a new hypothetical custom-ble protocol monitor tool and the command line tool named my-ble-monitor is launched with the -H parameter to start the monitor tool. In this case the command line pattern may contain any extra parameter in the formula: this is different from the monitor tools installed through the monitorDependencies field that must run without any command line parameter. We strongly recommend using this syntax only for development purposes and not on released platforms. Built-in monitors \u00b6 If a platform supports only boards connected via serial ports it can easily use the builtin:serial-monitor tool without creating a custom pluggable monitor: pluggable_monitor.required.serial=builtin:serial-monitor Backward compatibility \u00b6 For backward compatibility, if a platform does not declare any discovery or monitor tool (using the pluggable_discovery.* or pluggable_monitor.* properties in platform.txt respectively) it will automatically inherit builtin:serial-monitor (but not other builtin monitor tools that may be possibly added in the future). This will allow all legacy non-pluggable platforms to migrate to pluggable monitor without disruption. For detailed information, see the Pluggable Monitor specification . Port configuration \u00b6 Each pluggable monitor has its own default settings that can be overridden using the following board properties: BOARD_ID.monitor_port.PROTOCOL.SETTING_NAME=SETTING_VALUE where: BOARD_ID is the board identifier PROTOCOL is the port protocol SETTING_NAME and SETTING_VALUE are the port setting and the desired value For example, let's suppose that a board needs the baudrate setting of the serial port to be 9600 , then the corresponding properties in the boards.txt file will be: myboard.monitor_port.serial.baudrate=9600 The settings available in a specific pluggable monitor can be queried directly from it . Legacy serial.disableRTS and serial.disableDTR properties \u00b6 In the old Arduino IDE (<=1.8.x) we used the properties: BOARD_ID.serial.disableRTS=true BOARD_ID.serial.disableDTR=true to disable RTS and DTR when opening the serial monitor. To keep backward compatibilty the properties above are automatically converted to the corresponding pluggable monitor properties: BOARD_ID.monitor_port.serial.rts=off BOARD_ID.monitor_port.serial.dtr=off Verbose parameter \u00b6 It is possible for the user to enable verbosity from the Preferences panel of the IDEs or Arduino CLI's --verbose flag. This preference is transferred to the command line using the ACTION.verbose property (where ACTION is the action we are considering). When the verbose mode is enabled, the tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verbose property is copied into ACTION.verbose . When the verbose mode is disabled, the tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.quiet property is copied into ACTION.verbose . Confused? Maybe an example will make things clear: tools.avrdude.upload.params.verbose=-v -v -v -v tools.avrdude.upload.params.quiet=-q -q tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" {upload.verbose} -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.protocol} -P{serial.port} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" In this example if the user enables verbose mode, then {upload.params.verbose} is used in {upload.verbose} : tools.avrdude.upload.params.verbose => upload.verbose If the user didn't enable verbose mode, then {upload.params.quiet} is used in {upload.verbose} : tools.avrdude.upload.params.quiet => upload.verbose Sketch upload configuration \u00b6 The Upload action is triggered when the user clicks on the \"Upload\" button on the IDE toolbar or uses arduino-cli upload . Arduino uses the term \"upload\" for the process of transferring a program to the Arduino board. The upload.tool.<protocol_name> property determines the tool to be used for upload. A specific upload.tool.<protocol_name> property should be defined for every board in boards.txt: [......] uno.upload.tool.serial=avrdude [......] leonardo.upload.tool.serial=avrdude leonardo.upload.tool.network=arduino_ota [......] Multiple protocols can be defined for each board. When the user tries to upload using a protocol not supported by the board, it will fallback to default if one was defined: [......] uno.upload.tool.default=avrdude [......] leonardo.upload.tool.default=avrdude leonardo.upload.tool.network=arduino_ota [......] default is also used when no upload address is provided by the user. This can be used with tools that have built-in port detection (e.g., openocd ). For backward compatibility with IDE 1.8.15 and older the previous syntax is still supported: uno.upload.tool=avrdude The previous syntax is equivalent to: uno.upload.tool.default=avrdude Other upload parameters can also be defined for the board. For example, in the Arduino AVR Boards boards.txt we have: [.....] uno.name=Arduino Uno uno.upload.tool.serial=avrdude uno.upload.protocol=arduino uno.upload.maximum_size=32256 uno.upload.speed=115200 [.....] leonardo.name=Arduino Leonardo leonardo.upload.tool.serial=avrdude leonardo.upload.protocol=avr109 leonardo.upload.maximum_size=28672 leonardo.upload.speed=57600 leonardo.upload.use_1200bps_touch=true leonardo.upload.wait_for_upload_port=true [.....] Most {upload.XXXX} variables are used later in the avrdude upload recipe in platform.txt: [.....] tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" {upload.verbose} -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.port.protocol} -P{upload.port.address} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" [.....] If necessary the same property can be defined multiple times for different protocols: leonardo.upload.serial.speed=57600 leonardo.upload.network.speed=19200 The two above properties will be available as {upload.speed} , the value will depend on the protocol used to upload. Properties from pluggable discovery \u00b6 If a platform supports pluggable discovery it can also use the port's properties returned by a discovery. For example, the following port metadata coming from a pluggable discovery: { \"eventType\": \"add\", \"port\": { \"address\": \"/dev/ttyACM0\", \"label\": \"ttyACM0\", \"protocol\": \"serial\", \"protocolLabel\": \"Serial Port (USB)\", \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x804e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"serialNumber\": \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\", \"name\": \"ttyACM0\" } } } will be available on the recipe as the variables: {upload.port.address} = /dev/ttyACM0 {upload.port.label} = ttyACM0 {upload.port.protocol} = serial {upload.port.protocolLabel} = Serial Port (USB) {upload.port.properties.pid} = 0x8043 {upload.port.properties.vid} = 0x2341 {upload.port.properties.serialNumber} = EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E {upload.port.properties.name} = ttyACM0 {serial.port} = /dev/ttyACM0 # for backward compatibility {serial.port.file} = ttyACM0 # only because protocol=serial Here another example: { \"eventType\": \"add\", \"port\": { \"address\": \"192.168.1.232\", \"label\": \"SSH on my-board (192.168.1.232)\", \"protocol\": \"ssh\", \"protocolLabel\": \"SSH Network port\", \"properties\": { \"macprefix\": \"AA:BB:CC\", \"macaddress\": \"AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF\" } } } that is translated to: {upload.port.address} = 192.168.1.232 {upload.port.label} = SSH on my-board (192.168.1.232) {upload.port.protocol} = ssh {upload.port.protocolLabel} = SSH Network port {upload.port.properties.macprefix} = AA:BB:CC {upload.port.properties.macaddress} = AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF {serial.port} = 192.168.1.232 # for backward compatibility This configuration, together with protocol selection, allows to remove the hardcoded network_pattern . Now we can replace the legacy recipe (split into multiple lines for clarity): tools.bossac.upload.network_pattern=\"{runtime.tools.arduinoOTA.path}/bin/arduinoOTA\" -address {serial.port} -port 65280 -sketch \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.bin\" with: tools.arduino_ota.upload.pattern=\"{runtime.tools.arduinoOTA.path}/bin/arduinoOTA\" -address {upload.port.address} -port 65280 -sketch \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.bin\" User provided fields \u00b6 Some upload recipes might require custom fields that must be provided by the user, like username and password to upload over the network. In this case the recipe must use the special placeholder {upload.field.FIELD_NAME} , where FIELD_NAME must be declared separately in the recipe using the following format: tools.UPLOAD_RECIPE_ID.upload.field.FIELD_NAME=FIELD_LABEL tools.UPLOAD_RECIPE_ID.upload.field.FIELD_NAME.secret=true FIELD_LABEL is the label shown in the graphical prompt where the user is asked to enter the value for the field. The optional secret property should be set to true if the field is a secret (like a password or token). Let's see a complete example: tools.arduino_ota.upload.field.username=Username tools.arduino_ota.upload.field.password=Password tools.arduino_ota.upload.field.password.secret=true tools.arduino_ota.upload.pattern=\"{runtime.tools.arduinoOTA.path}/bin/arduinoOTA\" -address {upload.port.address} -port 65280 -username \"{upload.field.username} -password \"{upload.field.password}\" -sketch \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.bin\" If a FIELD_LABEL is longer than 50 characters it will be truncated to 49 characters and an ellipsis ( \u2026 ) appended to it. For example this field: tools.arduino_ota.upload.field.some_field=This is a really long label that ideally must never be set by any platform will be shown to the user as: This is a really long label that ideally must nev\u2026 Upload verification \u00b6 Upload verification can be enabled via the Arduino IDE's File > Preferences > Verify code after upload or arduino-cli upload --verify . This uses a system similar to the verbose parameter . tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify defines the value of the ACTION.verify property when verification is enabled and tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.noverify the value when verification is disabled. The {ACTION.verify} property is only defined for the upload and program actions of upload.tool . Prior to Arduino IDE 1.6.9, tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify/noverify were not supported and {upload.verify} was set to true / false according to the verification preference setting, while {program.verify} was left undefined. For this reason, backwards compatibility with older IDE versions requires the addition of definitions for the upload.verify and program.verify properties to platform.txt: [.....] tools.avrdude.upload.verify= [.....] tools.avrdude.program.verify= [.....] These definitions are overridden with the value defined by tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify/noverify when a modern version of Arduino development software is in use. 1200 bps bootloader reset \u00b6 Some Arduino boards use a dedicated USB-to-serial chip, that takes care of restarting the main MCU (starting the bootloader) when the serial port is opened. However, boards that have a native USB connection (such as the Leonardo or Zero) will have to disconnect from USB when rebooting into the bootloader (after which the bootloader reconnects to USB and offers a new serial port for uploading). After the upload is complete, the bootloader disconnects from USB again, starts the sketch, which then reconnects to USB. Because of these reconnections, the standard restart-on-serial open will not work, since that would cause the serial port to disappear and be closed again. Instead, the sketch running on these boards interprets a bitrate of 1200 bps as a signal the bootloader should be started. To let the Arduino development software perform these steps, two board properties can be set to true : use_1200bps_touch causes the selected serial port to be briefly opened at 1200 bps (8N1) before starting the upload. wait_for_upload_port causes the upload procedure to wait for the serial port to (re)appear before and after the upload. This is only used when use_1200bps_touch is also set. When set, after doing the 1200 bps touch, the development software will wait for a new serial port to appear and use that as the port for uploads. Alternatively, if the original port does not disappear within a few seconds, the upload continues with the original port (which can be the case if the board was already put into bootloader manually, or the the disconnect and reconnect was missed). Additionally, after the upload is complete, the IDE again waits for a new port to appear (or the originally selected port to be present). Note that the IDE implementation of this 1200 bps touch has some peculiarities, and the newer arduino-cli implementation also seems different (does not wait for the port after the reset, which is probably only needed in the IDE to prevent opening the wrong port on the serial monitor, and does not have a shorter timeout when the port never disappears). Upload Using Programmer by default \u00b6 If the upload.protocol property is not defined for a board, the Arduino IDE's \"Upload\" process will use the same behavior as \"Upload Using Programmer\" . This is convenient for boards which only support uploading via programmer. Serial port \u00b6 The full path (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0 ) of the port selected via the IDE or arduino-cli upload 's --port option is available as a configuration property {upload.port.address} . The file component of the port's path (e.g., ttyACM0 ) is available as the configuration property {upload.port.label} . For backward compatibility with IDE 1.8.15 and older the old property serial.port is still available and is identical to {upload.port.address} . Instead serial.port.file is identical to {upload.port.label} and available only if protocol in use is serial . Upload using an external programmer \u00b6 The program action is triggered via the Sketch > Upload Using Programmer feature of the IDEs or arduino-cli upload --programmer <programmer ID> . This action is used to transfer a compiled sketch to a board using an external programmer. The program.tool property determines the tool to be used for this action. This property is typically defined for each programmer in programmers.txt and uses the same syntax as the upload action : [......] usbasp.program.tool.serial=avrdude [......] arduinoasisp.program.tool.serial=avrdude [......] arduinoisp.program.tool.default=avrdude [......] For backward compatibility with IDE 1.8.15 and older the previous syntax is still supported: [......] usbasp.program.tool=avrdude [......] arduinoasisp.program.tool=avrdude [......] This action can use the same upload verification preference system as the upload action, via the program.verify property. When using the Arduino IDE, if the selected programmer is from a different platform than the board, the program recipe defined in the programmer's platform is used without overrides from the properties defined in the platform.txt of the board platform . When using Arduino development software other than the Arduino IDE, the handling of properties is the same as when doing a standard Upload . Burn Bootloader \u00b6 The erase and bootloader actions are triggered via the Tools > Burn Bootloader feature of the Arduino IDE or arduino-cli burn-bootloader . This action is used to flash a bootloader to the board. \"Burn Bootloader\" is unique in that it uses two actions, which are executed in sequence: erase is typically used to erase the microcontroller's flash memory and set the configuration fuses according to the properties defined in the board definition bootloader is used to flash the bootloader to the board The bootloader.tool property determines the tool to be used for the erase and bootloader actions both. This property is typically defined for each board in boards.txt and uses the same syntax as the upload action : [......] uno.bootloader.tool.serial=avrdude [......] leonardo.bootloader.tool.serial=avrdude leonardo.bootloader.tool.network=arduino_ota [......] duemilanove.bootloader.tool.default=avrdude [......] For backward compatibility with IDE 1.8.15 and older the previous syntax is still supported: [......] uno.bootloader.tool=avrdude [......] leonardo.bootloader.tool=avrdude [......] When using the Arduino IDE, if the board uses a core reference , the platform.txt of the core platform is not used at all in defining the recipes for erase and bootloader actions. When using Arduino development software other than the Arduino IDE, the handling of properties from the core platform's platform.txt is done as usual. Sketch debugging configuration \u00b6 Starting from Arduino CLI 0.9.0 / Arduino IDE 2.x, sketch debugging support is available for platforms. The debug action is triggered when the user clicks the Debug button in the Arduino IDE or runs the arduino-cli debug command. The compiler optimization level that is appropriate for normal usage will often not provide a good experience while debugging. For this reason, it may be helpful to use different compiler flags when compiling a sketch for use with the debugger. The flags for use when compiling for debugging can be defined via the compiler.optimization_flags.debug property, and those for normal use via the compiler.optimization_flags.release property. The compiler.optimization_flags property will be defined according to one or the other depending on the Arduino Pro IDE's Sketch > Optimize for Debugging setting or arduino-cli compile 's --optimize-for-debug option. Custom board options \u00b6 It can sometimes be useful to provide user selectable configuration options for a specific board. For example, a board could be provided in two or more variants with different microcontrollers, or may have different crystal speed based on the board model, and so on... When using Arduino CLI, the option can be selected via the FQBN, or using the --board-options flag In the Arduino IDE the options add extra menu items under the \"Tools\" menu. In Arduino Web Editor, the options are displayed in the \"Flavours\" menu. Let's see an example of how a custom option is implemented. The board used in the example is the Arduino Duemilanove. This board was produced in two models, one with an ATmega168 microcontroller and another with an ATmega328P. We are going then to define a custom option, using the \"cpu\" MENU_ID, that allows the user to choose between the two different microcontrollers. We must first define a set of menu.MENU_ID=Text properties. Text is what is displayed on the GUI for every custom menu we are going to create and must be declared at the beginning of the boards.txt file: menu.cpu=Processor [.....] in this case, the menu name is \"Processor\". Now let's add, always in the boards.txt file, the default configuration (common to all processors) for the duemilanove board: menu.cpu=Processor [.....] duemilanove.name=Arduino Duemilanove duemilanove.upload.tool=avrdude duemilanove.upload.protocol=arduino duemilanove.build.f_cpu=16000000L duemilanove.build.board=AVR_DUEMILANOVE duemilanove.build.core=arduino duemilanove.build.variant=standard [.....] Now let's define the possible values of the \"cpu\" option: [.....] duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328=ATmega328P [.....] duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168=ATmega168 [.....] We have defined two values: \"atmega328\" and \"atmega168\". Note that the property keys must follow the format BOARD_ID.menu.MENU_ID.OPTION_ID=Text , where Text is what is displayed under the \"Processor\" menu in the IDE's GUI. Finally, the specific configuration for each option value: [.....] ## Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328P duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328=ATmega328P duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.upload.maximum_size=30720 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.upload.speed=57600 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.build.mcu=atmega328p ## Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega168 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168=ATmega168 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.maximum_size=14336 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.speed=19200 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.build.mcu=atmega168 [.....] Note that when the user selects an option value, all the \"sub properties\" of that value are copied in the global configuration. For example, when the user selects \"ATmega168\" from the \"Processor\" menu, or uses the FQBN arduino:avr:duemilanove:cpu=atmega168 with Arduino CLI, the configuration under atmega168 is made available globally: duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.maximum_size => upload.maximum_size duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.speed => upload.speed duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.build.mcu => build.mcu There is no limit to the number of custom menus that can be defined. Referencing another core, variant or tool \u00b6 The Arduino platform referencing system allows using components of other platforms in cases where it would otherwise be necessary to duplicate those components. This feature allows us to reduce the minimum set of files needed to define a new \"hardware\" to just the boards.txt file. Core reference \u00b6 Inside the boards.txt we can define a board that uses a core provided by another vendor/maintainer using the syntax VENDOR_ID:CORE_ID . For example, if we want to define a board that uses the \"arduino\" core from the \"arduino\" vendor we should write: [....] myboard.name=My Wonderful Arduino Compatible board myboard.build.core=arduino:arduino [....] Note that we don't need to specify any architecture since the same architecture of \"myboard\" is used, so we just say \"arduino:arduino\" instead of \"arduino:avr:arduino\". The platform.txt settings are inherited from the referenced core platform, thus there is no need to provide a platform.txt unless there are some specific properties that need to be overridden. The bundled libraries from the referenced platform are used, thus there is no need for the referencing platform to bundle those libraries. If libraries are provided, the list of available libraries is the sum of the two libraries, where the referencing platform has priority over the referenced platform. The programmers from the referenced platform are made available, thus there is no need for the referencing platform to define those programmers. If the referencing platform does provide its own programmer definitions, the list of available programmer is the sum of the programmers of the two platforms. In Arduino IDE 1.8.12 and older, all programmers of all installed platforms were made available. Variant reference \u00b6 In the same way we can use a variant defined on another platform using the syntax VENDOR_ID:VARIANT_ID : [....] myboard.build.variant=arduino:standard [....] Note that, unlike core references, other resources (platform.txt, bundled libraries, programmers) are not inherited from the referenced platform. Tool references \u00b6 Tool recipes defined in the platform.txt of other platforms can also be referenced using the syntax VENDOR_ID:TOOL_ID : [....] myboard.upload.tool=arduino:avrdude myboard.bootloader.tool=arduino:avrdude [....] When using Arduino CLI or Arduino IDE 2.x (but not Arduino IDE 1.x), properties used in the referenced tool recipe may be overridden in the referencing platform's platform.txt. Note that, unlike core references, referencing a tool recipe does not result in any other resources being inherited from the referenced platform. Platform Terminology \u00b6 Because boards can reference cores, variants and tools in different platforms, this means that a single build or upload can use data from up to four different platforms. To keep this clear, the following terminology is used: The \"board platform\" is the platform that defines the currently selected board (e.g. the platform that contains the board.txt the board is defined in. The \"core platform\" is the the platform that contains the core to be used. The \"variant platform\" is the platform that contains the variant to be used. The \"tool platform\" is the platform that contains the tool used for the current operation. In the most common case: a board platform without any references, all of these will refer to the same platform. Note that the above terminology is not in widespread use, but was invented for clarity within this document. In the actual Arduino CLI code, the \"board platform\" is called targetPlatform , the \"core platform\" is called actualPlatform , the others are pretty much nameless. boards.local.txt \u00b6 Introduced in Arduino IDE 1.6.6. This file can be used to override properties defined in boards.txt or define new properties without modifying boards.txt . It must be placed in the same folder as the boards.txt it supplements. Platform bundled libraries \u00b6 Arduino libraries placed in the platform's libraries subfolder are accessible when a board of the platform, or of a platform that references the platform's core, is selected. When any other board is selected, the platform bundled libraries are inaccessible. These are often architecture-specific libraries (e.g., SPI, Wire) which must be implemented differently for each architecture. Platform bundled libraries may be used to provide specialized versions of libraries which use the dependency resolution system to override built-in libraries. For more information, see the Arduino library specification . keywords.txt \u00b6 As of Arduino IDE 1.6.6, per-platform keywords can be defined by adding a keywords.txt file to the platform's architecture folder. These keywords are only highlighted in the Arduino IDE when one of the boards of that platform are selected. This file follows the same format as the keywords.txt used in libraries. Post-install script \u00b6 After Boards Manager finishes installation of a platform, it checks for the presence of a script named: post_install.bat - when running on Windows post_install.sh - when running on any non-Windows operating system If present, the script is executed. This script may be used to configure the user's system for the platform, such as installing drivers. The circumstances under which the post-install script will run are different depending on which Arduino development software is in use: Arduino IDE 1.x : runs the script when the installed platform is signed with Arduino's private key. Arduino IDE 2.x : runs the script for any installed platform. Arduino CLI : (since 0.12.0) runs the script for any installed platform when Arduino CLI is in \"interactive\" mode. This behavior can be configured","title":"Platform specification"},{"location":"platform-specification/#hardware-folders-structure","text":"The new hardware folders have a hierarchical structure organized in two levels: the first level is the vendor/maintainer the second level is the supported architecture A vendor/maintainer can have multiple supported architectures.

An extract of the Uno board configuration in boards.txt looks like: [......] uno.name=Arduino Uno uno.build.mcu=atmega328p uno.build.f_cpu=16000000L uno.build.board=AVR_UNO uno.build.core=arduino uno.build.variant=standard [......] Note that all the relevant keys start with the board ID uno.xxxxx . The uno.name property contains the human-friendly name of the board. This is shown in the Board menu of the IDEs, the \"Board Name\" field of Arduino CLI's text output, or the \"name\" key of Arduino CLI's JSON output. The uno.build.board property is used to set a compile-time macro ARDUINO_{build.board} to allow use of conditional code between #ifdef s. If not defined, a build.board value is automatically generated and the Arduino development software outputs a warning. In this case the macro defined at compile time will be ARDUINO_AVR_UNO . The other properties will override the corresponding global properties when the user selects the board. These properties will be globally available, in other configuration files too, without the board ID prefix: uno.build.mcu => build.mcu uno.build.f_cpu => build.f_cpu uno.build.board => build.board uno.build.core => build.core uno.build.variant => build.variant This explains the presence of {build.mcu} or {build.board} in the platform.txt recipes: their value is overwritten respectively by {uno.build.mcu} and {uno.build.board} when the Uno board is selected! Moreover the following properties are automatically generated: {build.core.path} : The path to the selected board's core folder (inside the core platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/core/arduino) {build.system.path} : The path to the core platform 's system folder if available (for example hardware/arduino/sam/system) {build.variant.path} : The path to the selected board variant folder (inside the variant platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/variants/micro) If the platform supports pluggable discovery it may also declare a set of upload_port.* properties, these properties will be used to identify a board by the discovery process when plugged in. For example we could declare a series of upload_port.vid and upload_port.pid properties for the Uno like so: uno.upload_port.vid.0=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.0=0x0043 uno.upload_port.vid.1=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.1=0x0001 uno.upload_port.vid.2=0x2A03 uno.upload_port.pid.2=0x0043 uno.upload_port.vid.3=0x2341 uno.upload_port.pid.3=0x0243 In this case we're using the board's USB VID/PID pair to identify it but upload_port.* properties can be anything that can help identify a certain board.

In Arduino Web Editor, the options are displayed in the \"Flavours\" menu. Let's see an example of how a custom option is implemented. The board used in the example is the Arduino Duemilanove. This board was produced in two models, one with an ATmega168 microcontroller and another with an ATmega328P.

These tools must be in the form of executables that can be launched as a subprocess using a platform.txt command line recipe. They communicate to the parent process via stdin/stdout, accepting commands as plain text strings from stdin and sending answers back in JSON format on stdout. Each tool will implement the commands to list and enumerate ports for a specific protocol as specified in this document. Pluggable discovery API via stdin/stdout \u00b6 All the commands listed in this specification must be implemented in the discovery. After startup, the tool will just stay idle waiting for commands. The available commands are: HELLO , START , STOP , QUIT , LIST and START_SYNC . After each command the client always expects a response from the discovery. The discovery must not introduce any delay and must respond to all commands as fast as possible. HELLO command \u00b6 HELLO must be the first command sent to the discovery to tell the name of the client/IDE and the version of the pluggable discovery protocol that the client/IDE supports. The syntax of the command is: HELLO <PROTOCOL_VERSION> \"<USER_AGENT>\" <PROTOCOL_VERSION> is the maximum protocol version supported by the client/IDE (currently 1 ) <USER_AGENT> is the name and version of the client. It must not contain double-quotes ( \" ). some examples: HELLO 1 \"Arduino IDE 1.8.13\" HELLO 1 \"arduino-cli 1.2.3\" the response to the command is: { \"eventType\" : \"hello\" , \"protocolVersion\" : 1 , \"message\" : \"OK\" } The protocolVersion field represents the protocol version that will be used in the rest of the communication. There are three possible cases: if the client/IDE supports the same or a more recent version of the protocol than the discovery, then the client/IDE should go into a compatibility mode and use the protocol level supported by the discovery. if the discovery supports a more recent version of the protocol than the client/IDE: the discovery should downgrade itself into compatibility mode and report a protocolVersion that is less than or equal to the one supported by the client/IDE. if the discovery cannot go into compatibility mode, it must report the protocol version supported (even if greater than the version supported by the client/IDE) and the client/IDE may decide to terminate the discovery or produce an error/warning. START command \u00b6 The START command initializes and starts the discovery internal subroutines. This command must be called before LIST . The response to the start command is: { \"eventType\" : \"start\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } If the discovery could not start, for any reason, it must report the error with: { \"eventType\" : \"start\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Permission error\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error. STOP command \u00b6 The STOP command stops the discovery internal subroutines and possibly frees the internally used resources. This command should be called if the client wants to pause the discovery for a while. The response to the command is: { \"eventType\" : \"stop\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } If an error occurs: { \"eventType\" : \"stop\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Resource busy\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error. QUIT command \u00b6 The QUIT command terminates the discovery. The response to QUIT is: { \"eventType\" : \"quit\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } after this output the discovery exits. This command is supposed to always succeed. LIST command \u00b6 The LIST command executes an enumeration of the ports and returns a list of the available ports at the moment of the call. The format of the response is the following: { \"eventType\": \"list\", \"ports\": [ { \"address\": <-- THE ADDRESS OF THE PORT \"label\": <-- HOW THE PORT IS DISPLAYED ON THE GUI \"protocol\": <-- THE PROTOCOL USED BY THE BOARD \"protocolLabel\": <-- HOW THE PROTOCOL IS DISPLAYED ON THE GUI \"hardwareId\": <-- A STRING THAT UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES A BOARD INSTANCE \"properties\": { <-- A LIST OF PROPERTIES OF THE PORT } }, { ... <-- OTHER PORTS... } ] } The ports field contains a list of the available ports. Each port has: an address (for example /dev/ttyACM0 for serial ports or 192.168.10.100 for network ports) a label that is the human readable form of the address (it may be for example ttyACM0 or SSH on 192.168.10.100 ) protocol is the protocol identifier (such as serial or dfu or ssh ) protocolLabel is the protocol in human readable form (for example Serial port or DFU USB or Network (ssh) ) hardwareId (optional) a string that uniquely identifies a specific board instance (even among other boards of the same model). Different ports with the same hardwareId must belong to the same board instance. The identifier should be sufficiently long to uniquely identify the board instance and reduce the probability of collisions. Good examples of hardwareId values are: Ethernet MAC Address, USB Serial Number, CPU-ID number, etc. This value should not be used to identify the board model (see the board identification section for more information about identification of the board model). properties is a list of key/value pairs that represent information relative to the specific port. To make the above more clear let's show an example output from the serial-discovery builtin in the Arduino CLI: { \"eventType\" : \"list\" , \"ports\" : [ { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"label\" : \"ttyACM0\" , \"protocol\" : \"serial\" , \"protocolLabel\" : \"Serial Port (USB)\" , \"hardwareId\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"properties\" : { \"pid\" : \"0x804e\" , \"vid\" : \"0x2341\" , \"serialNumber\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"name\" : \"ttyACM0\" } } ] } In this case the serial port metadata comes from a USB serial converter. Inside the properties we have all the properties of the port, and some of them may be useful for product identification (in this case only USB VID/PID is useful to identify the board model). The hardwareId field is populated with the USB serialNumber since this value is useful to identify the board instance. The LIST command performs a one-shot polling of the ports. The discovery should answer as soon as reasonably possible, without any additional delay. Some discoveries may require some time to discover a new port (for example network protocols like MDNS, Bluetooth, etc. require some seconds to receive the broadcasts from all available clients) in that case it is fine to answer with an empty or incomplete list. If an error occurs and the discovery can't complete the enumeration, it must report the error with: { \"eventType\" : \"list\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Resource busy\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error. START_SYNC command \u00b6 The START_SYNC command puts the tool in \"events\" mode: the discovery will send add and remove events each time a new port is detected or removed respectively. If the discovery goes into \"events\" mode successfully the response to this command is: { \"eventType\" : \"start_sync\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } After this message the discovery will send add and remove events asynchronously (more on that later). If an error occurs and the discovery can't go in \"events\" mode the error must be reported as: { \"eventType\" : \"start_sync\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Resource busy\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error. Once in \"event\" mode, the discovery is allowed to send add and remove messages asynchronously in realtime, this means that the client must be able to handle these incoming messages at any moment. The add event looks like the following: { \"eventType\" : \"add\" , \"port\" : { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"label\" : \"ttyACM0\" , \"hardwareId\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"properties\" : { \"pid\" : \"0x804e\" , \"vid\" : \"0x2341\" , \"serialNumber\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"name\" : \"ttyACM0\" }, \"protocol\" : \"serial\" , \"protocolLabel\" : \"Serial Port (USB)\" } } It basically provides the same information as the list event but for a single port. After calling START_SYNC an initial burst of add events must be generated in sequence to report all the ports available at the moment of the start. The remove event looks like the following: { \"eventType\" : \"remove\" , \"port\" : { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"protocol\" : \"serial\" } } The content is straightforward, in this case only the address and protocol fields are reported. If the information about a port needs to be updated the discovery may send a new add message for the same port address and protocol without sending a remove first: this means that all the previous information about the port must be discarded and replaced with the new one. Invalid commands \u00b6 If the client sends an invalid or malformed command, the discovery should answer with: { \"eventType\" : \"command_error\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Unknown command XXXX\" } State machine \u00b6 A well behaved pluggable discovery tool must reflect the following state machine. The arrows represent the commands outlined in the above sections, calling a command successfully assumes the state changes. A pluggable discovery state is Alive when the process has been started but no command has been executed. Dead means the process has been stopped and no further commands can be received. Board identification \u00b6 The properties associated to a port can be used to identify the board attached to that port. The algorithm is simple: each board listed in the platform file boards.txt may declare a set of upload_port.* properties if each upload_port.* property has a match in the properties set coming from the discovery then the board is a \"candidate\" board attached to that port. Some port properties may not be precise enough to uniquely identify a board, in that case more boards may match the same set of properties , that's why we called it \"candidate\". Let's see an example to clarify things a bit, let's suppose that we have the following properties coming from the serial discovery: \"port\": { \"address\": \"/dev/ttyACM0\", \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x804e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"serialNumber\": \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\", \"name\": \"ttyACM0\" }, ... in this case we can use vid and pid to identify the board. The serialNumber , instead, is unique for that specific instance of the board so it can't be used to identify the board model. Let's suppose we have the following boards.txt : # Arduino Zero (Programming Port) # --------------------------------------- arduino_zero_edbg.name=Arduino Zero (Programming Port) arduino_zero_edbg.upload_port.vid=0x03eb arduino_zero_edbg.upload_port.pid=0x2157 [...CUT...] # Arduino Zero (Native USB Port) # -------------------------------------- arduino_zero_native.name=Arduino Zero (Native USB Port) arduino_zero_native.upload_port.0.vid=0x2341 arduino_zero_native.upload_port.0.pid=0x804d arduino_zero_native.upload_port.1.vid=0x2341 arduino_zero_native.upload_port.1.pid=0x004d arduino_zero_native.upload_port.2.vid=0x2341 arduino_zero_native.upload_port.2.pid=0x824d arduino_zero_native.upload_port.3.vid=0x2341 arduino_zero_native.upload_port.3.pid=0x024d [...CUT...] # Arduino MKR1000 # ----------------------- mkr1000.name=Arduino MKR1000 mkr1000.upload_port.0.vid=0x2341 <------- MATCHING IDs mkr1000.upload_port.0.pid=0x804e <------- MATCHING IDs mkr1000.upload_port.1.vid=0x2341 mkr1000.upload_port.1.pid=0x004e mkr1000.upload_port.2.vid=0x2341 mkr1000.upload_port.2.pid=0x824e mkr1000.upload_port.3.vid=0x2341 mkr1000.upload_port.3.pid=0x024e [...CUT...] As we can see the only board that has the two properties matching is the mkr1000 , in this case the CLI knows that the board is surely an MKR1000. Note that vid and pid properties are just free text key/value pairs: the discovery may return basically anything, the board just needs to have the same properties defined in boards.txt as upload_port.* to be identified. We can also specify multiple identification properties for the same board using the .N suffix, for example: myboard.name=My Wonderful Arduino Compatible Board myboard.upload_port.pears=20 myboard.upload_port.apples=30 will match on pears=20, apples=30 but: myboard.name=My Wonderful Arduino Compatible Board myboard.upload_port.0.pears=20 myboard.upload_port.0.apples=30 myboard.upload_port.1.pears=30 myboard.upload_port.1.apples=40 will match on both pears=20, apples=30 and pears=30, apples=40 but not pears=20, apples=40 , in that sense each \"set\" of identification properties is independent from each other and cannot be mixed for port matching. Identification of board options \u00b6 Custom board options can also be identified. Identification property values are associated with a custom board option by the board definition in boards.txt . Two formats are available. If only a single set of identification properties are associated with the option: BOARD_ID.menu.MENU_ID.OPTION_ID.upload_port.PORT_PROPERTY_KEY=PORT_PROPERTY_VALUE If one or more sets of identification properties are associated with the option, an index number is used for each set: BOARD_ID.menu.MENU_ID.OPTION_ID.upload_port.SET_INDEX.PORT_PROPERTY_KEY=PORT_PROPERTY_VALUE If multiple identification properties are associated within a set, all must match for the option to be identified. Let's see an example to clarify it, in the following boards.txt : myboard.upload_port.pid=0x0010 myboard.upload_port.vid=0x2341 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega1280=ATmega1280 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega1280.upload_port.c=atmega1280 <--- identification property for cpu=atmega1280 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega1280.build_cpu=atmega1280 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega2560=ATmega2560 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega2560.upload_port.c=atmega2560 <--- identification property for cpu=atmega2560 myboard.menu.cpu.atmega2560.build_cpu=atmega2560 myboard.menu.mem.1k=1KB myboard.menu.mem.1k.upload_port.mem=1 <--- identification property for mem=1k myboard.menu.mem.1k.build_mem=1024 myboard.menu.mem.2k=2KB myboard.menu.mem.2k.upload_port.1.mem=2 <------ identification property for mem=2k (case 1) myboard.menu.mem.2k.upload_port.2.ab=ef <---\\ myboard.menu.mem.2k.upload_port.2.cd=gh <---+-- identification property for mem=2k (case 2) myboard.menu.mem.2k.build_mem=2048 we have a board called myboard with two custom menu options cpu and mem .

Each port has: an address (for example /dev/ttyACM0 for serial ports or 192.168.10.100 for network ports) a label that is the human readable form of the address (it may be for example ttyACM0 or SSH on 192.168.10.100 ) protocol is the protocol identifier (such as serial or dfu or ssh ) protocolLabel is the protocol in human readable form (for example Serial port or DFU USB or Network (ssh) ) hardwareId (optional) a string that uniquely identifies a specific board instance (even among other boards of the same model). Different ports with the same hardwareId must belong to the same board instance. The identifier should be sufficiently long to uniquely identify the board instance and reduce the probability of collisions. Good examples of hardwareId values are: Ethernet MAC Address, USB Serial Number, CPU-ID number, etc. This value should not be used to identify the board model (see the board identification section for more information about identification of the board model). properties is a list of key/value pairs that represent information relative to the specific port. To make the above more clear let's show an example output from the serial-discovery builtin in the Arduino CLI: { \"eventType\" : \"list\" , \"ports\" : [ { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"label\" : \"ttyACM0\" , \"protocol\" : \"serial\" , \"protocolLabel\" : \"Serial Port (USB)\" , \"hardwareId\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"properties\" : { \"pid\" : \"0x804e\" , \"vid\" : \"0x2341\" , \"serialNumber\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"name\" : \"ttyACM0\" } } ] } In this case the serial port metadata comes from a USB serial converter. Inside the properties we have all the properties of the port, and some of them may be useful for product identification (in this case only USB VID/PID is useful to identify the board model). The hardwareId field is populated with the USB serialNumber since this value is useful to identify the board instance. The LIST command performs a one-shot polling of the ports. The discovery should answer as soon as reasonably possible, without any additional delay. Some discoveries may require some time to discover a new port (for example network protocols like MDNS, Bluetooth, etc. require some seconds to receive the broadcasts from all available clients) in that case it is fine to answer with an empty or incomplete list. If an error occurs and the discovery can't complete the enumeration, it must report the error with: { \"eventType\" : \"list\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Resource busy\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error.","title":"LIST command"},{"location":"pluggable-discovery-specification/#start_sync-command","text":"The START_SYNC command puts the tool in \"events\" mode: the discovery will send add and remove events each time a new port is detected or removed respectively. If the discovery goes into \"events\" mode successfully the response to this command is: { \"eventType\" : \"start_sync\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } After this message the discovery will send add and remove events asynchronously (more on that later). If an error occurs and the discovery can't go in \"events\" mode the error must be reported as: { \"eventType\" : \"start_sync\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Resource busy\" } The error field must be set to true and the message field should contain a description of the error. Once in \"event\" mode, the discovery is allowed to send add and remove messages asynchronously in realtime, this means that the client must be able to handle these incoming messages at any moment. The add event looks like the following: { \"eventType\" : \"add\" , \"port\" : { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"label\" : \"ttyACM0\" , \"hardwareId\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"properties\" : { \"pid\" : \"0x804e\" , \"vid\" : \"0x2341\" , \"serialNumber\" : \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\" , \"name\" : \"ttyACM0\" }, \"protocol\" : \"serial\" , \"protocolLabel\" : \"Serial Port (USB)\" } } It basically provides the same information as the list event but for a single port. After calling START_SYNC an initial burst of add events must be generated in sequence to report all the ports available at the moment of the start. The remove event looks like the following: { \"eventType\" : \"remove\" , \"port\" : { \"address\" : \"/dev/ttyACM0\" , \"protocol\" : \"serial\" } } The content is straightforward, in this case only the address and protocol fields are reported. If the information about a port needs to be updated the discovery may send a new add message for the same port address and protocol without sending a remove first: this means that all the previous information about the port must be discarded and replaced with the new one.","title":"START_SYNC command"},{"location":"pluggable-discovery-specification/#invalid-commands","text":"If the client sends an invalid or malformed command, the discovery should answer with: { \"eventType\" : \"command_error\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"Unknown command XXXX\" }","title":"Invalid commands"},{"location":"pluggable-discovery-specification/#state-machine","text":"A well behaved pluggable discovery tool must reflect the following state machine.

The algorithm is simple: each board listed in the platform file boards.txt may declare a set of upload_port.* properties if each upload_port.* property has a match in the properties set coming from the discovery then the board is a \"candidate\" board attached to that port. Some port properties may not be precise enough to uniquely identify a board, in that case more boards may match the same set of properties , that's why we called it \"candidate\". Let's see an example to clarify things a bit, let's suppose that we have the following properties coming from the serial discovery: \"port\": { \"address\": \"/dev/ttyACM0\", \"properties\": { \"pid\": \"0x804e\", \"vid\": \"0x2341\", \"serialNumber\": \"EBEABFD6514D32364E202020FF10181E\", \"name\": \"ttyACM0\" }, ... in this case we can use vid and pid to identify the board.

A platform developer can create their own tools following the specification below. These tools must be in the form of command line executables that can be launched as a subprocess. They will communicate to the parent process via stdin/stdout, in particular a monitor tool will accept commands as plain text strings from stdin and will send answers back in JSON format on stdout. Each tool will implement the commands to open and control communication ports for a specific protocol as specified in this document. The actual I/O data stream from the communication port will be transferred to the parent process through a separate channel via TCP/IP. Pluggable monitor API via stdin/stdout \u00b6 All the commands listed in this specification must be implemented in the monitor tool. After startup, the tool will just stay idle waiting for commands. The available commands are: HELLO , DESCRIBE , CONFIGURE , OPEN , CLOSE and QUIT . After each command the client always expects a response from the monitor. The monitor must not introduce any delay and must respond to all commands as fast as possible. HELLO command \u00b6 HELLO must be the first command sent to the monitor to tell the name of the client/IDE and the version of the pluggable monitor protocol that the client/IDE supports. The syntax of the command is: HELLO <PROTOCOL_VERSION> \"<USER_AGENT>\" <PROTOCOL_VERSION> is the maximum protocol version supported by the client/IDE (currently 1 ) <USER_AGENT> is the name and version of the client. It must not contain double-quotes ( \" ). some examples: HELLO 1 \"Arduino IDE 1.8.13\" HELLO 1 \"arduino-cli 1.2.3\" the response to the command is: { \"eventType\" : \"hello\" , \"protocolVersion\" : 1 , \"message\" : \"OK\" } The protocolVersion field represents the protocol version that will be used in the rest of the communication. There are three possible cases: if the client/IDE supports the same or a more recent version of the protocol than the monitor tool, then the client/IDE should go into a compatibility mode and use the protocol level supported by the monitor tool. if the monitor tool supports a more recent version of the protocol than the client/IDE, then the monitor tool should downgrade itself into compatibility mode and report a protocolVersion that is less than or equal to the one supported by the client/IDE. if the monitor tool cannot go into compatibility mode, it must report the protocol version supported (even if greater than the version supported by the client/IDE) and the client/IDE may decide to terminate the monitor tool or produce an error/warning. DESCRIBE command \u00b6 The DESCRIBE command returns a description of the communication port. The description will have metadata about the port configuration, and which parameters are available to the user. { \"eventType\" : \"describe\" , \"message\" : \"ok\" , \"port_description\" : { \"protocol\" : \"serial\" , \"configuration_parameters\" : { \"baudrate\" : { \"label\" : \"Baudrate\" , \"type\" : \"enum\" , \"value\" : [ \"300\" , \"600\" , \"750\" , \"1200\" , \"2400\" , \"4800\" , \"9600\" , \"19200\" , \"38400\" , \"57600\" , \"115200\" , \"230400\" , \"460800\" , \"500000\" , \"921600\" , \"1000000\" , \"2000000\" ], \"selected\" : \"9600\" }, \"parity\" : { \"label\" : \"Parity\" , \"type\" : \"enum\" , \"value\" : [ \"N\" , \"E\" , \"O\" , \"M\" , \"S\" ], \"selected\" : \"N\" }, \"bits\" : { \"label\" : \"Data bits\" , \"type\" : \"enum\" , \"value\" : [ \"5\" , \"6\" , \"7\" , \"8\" , \"9\" ], \"selected\" : \"8\" }, \"stop_bits\" : { \"label\" : \"Stop bits\" , \"type\" : \"enum\" , \"value\" : [ \"1\" , \"1.5\" , \"2\" ], \"selected\" : \"1\" } } } } The field protocol is the board port protocol identifier, it must match with the corresponding protocol identifier for a pluggable discovery tool. configuration_parameters is a key/value map that enumerates the available port parameters. Each parameter has a unique name ( baudrate , parity , etc...), a type (in this case only enum is allowed but more types may be added in the future if needed), and the selected value for each parameter. The parameter name can not contain spaces, the allowed characters are alphanumerics, underscore _ , dot . , and dash - . The enum types must have a list of possible values in the value list field. The client/IDE may expose these configuration values to the user via a config file or a GUI, in this case the label field may be used for a user readable description of the parameter. CONFIGURE command \u00b6 The CONFIGURE command sets configuration parameters for the communication port. The parameters can be changed one at a time and the syntax is: CONFIGURE <PARAMETER_NAME> <VALUE> The response to the command is: { \"eventType\" : \"configure\" , \"message\" : \"ok\" } or if there is an error: { \"eventType\" : \"configure\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"invalid value for parameter baudrate: 123456\" } The currently selected parameters or their default value may be obtained using the DESCRIBE command. OPEN command \u00b6 The OPEN command opens a communication port with the board, the data exchanged with the board will be transferred to the Client/IDE via TCP/IP. The Client/IDE must first TCP-Listen to a randomly selected TCP port and send the address to connect it to the monitor tool as part of the OPEN command. The syntax of the OPEN command is: OPEN <CLIENT_TCPIP_ADDRESS> <BOARD_PORT> For example, let's suppose that the Client/IDE wants to communicate with the serial port /dev/ttyACM0 using an hypothetical serial-monitor tool, then the sequence of actions to perform will be the following: the Client/IDE must first listen to a random TCP port (let's suppose it chose 32123 ) the Client/IDE runs the serial-monitor tool and initializes it with the HELLO command the Client/IDE sends the command OPEN 127.0.0.1:32123 /dev/ttyACM0 to the monitor tool the monitor tool opens /dev/ttyACM0 the monitor tool connects via TCP/IP to 127.0.0.1:32123 and starts streaming data back and forth The answer to the OPEN command is: { \"eventType\" : \"open\" , \"message\" : \"ok\" } If the monitor tool cannot communicate with the board, or if the tool can not connect back to the TCP port, or if any other error condition happens: { \"eventType\" : \"open\" , \"error\" : true , \"message\" : \"unknown port /dev/ttyACM23\" } The board port will be opened using the parameters previously set through the CONFIGURE command. Once the port is opened, it may be unexpectedly closed at any time due to hardware failure, or because the Client/IDE closes the TCP/IP connection, etc. In this case an asynchronous port_closed message must be generated by the monitor tool: { \"eventType\" : \"port_closed\" , \"message\" : \"serial port disappeared!\" } or { \"eventType\" : \"port_closed\" , \"message\" : \"lost TCP/IP connection with the client!\" } CLOSE command \u00b6 The CLOSE command will close the currently opened port and close the TCP/IP connection used to communicate with the Client/IDE.

The response to QUIT is: { \"eventType\" : \"quit\" , \"message\" : \"OK\" } after this output the monitor exits. This command must always succeed.

More useful information can be found in the Arduino platform specification . Note that the following refers specifically to the build process for AVR targets. Other architectures follow a similar build process, but may use other tools and compilers. Overview \u00b6 A number of things have to happen for your Arduino code to get onto the Arduino board. First, the Arduino development software performs some minor pre-processing to turn your sketch into a C++ program. Next, dependencies of the sketch are located. It then gets passed to a compiler (e.g, avr-gcc ), which turns the human readable code into machine readable instructions (or object files). Then your code gets combined with (linked against) the standard Arduino libraries that provide basic functions like digitalWrite() or Serial.print() . The result is a single Intel hex file, which contains the specific bytes that need to be written to the program memory of the chip on the Arduino board. This file is then uploaded to the board: transmitted over the USB or serial connection via the bootloader already on the chip or with external programming hardware. Pre-Processing \u00b6 The Arduino development software performs a few transformations to your sketch before passing it to the compiler (e.g., avr-gcc ): All .ino and .pde files in the sketch folder (shown in the Arduino IDE as tabs with no extension) are concatenated together, starting with the file that matches the folder name followed by the others in alphabetical order. The .cpp filename extension is then added to the resulting file. If not already present, #include <Arduino.h> is added to the sketch. This header file (found in the core folder for the currently selected board) includes all the definitions needed for the standard Arduino core. Prototypes are generated for all function definitions in .ino/.pde files that don't already have prototypes. In some rare cases, prototype generation may fail for some functions. To work around this, you can provide your own prototypes for these functions. #line directives are added to make warning or error messages reflect the original sketch layout. No pre-processing is done to files in a sketch with any extension other than .ino or .pde. Additionally, .h files in the sketch are not automatically #included from the main sketch file. Further, if you want to call functions defined in a .c file from a .cpp file (like one generated from your sketch), you'll need to wrap its declarations in an extern \"C\" {} block that is defined only inside of C++ files. Dependency Resolution \u00b6 The sketch is scanned recursively for dependencies. There are predefined include search paths: Core library folder (as defined by {build.core} ) Variant folder (as defined by {build.variant} ) Standard system directories (e.g., {runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path}/avr/include ) Include search paths added to resolve prior dependencies If the dependency is not present in any of those locations, the installed libraries are then searched (see the Location Priority table below for library locations). For information on the allowed library sub-folder structures see the Arduino library specification . -I options are generated for the path to each library dependency and appended to the includes property , to be used in compilation recipes in platform.txt. If multiple libraries contain a file that matches the #include directive, the priority is determined by applying the following rules, one by one in this order, until a rule determines a winner: A library that has been specified using the --library option of arduino-cli compile wins against a library in other locations A library that is architecture compatible wins against a library that is not architecture compatible (see Architecture Matching ) A library with both library name and folder name matching the include wins A library that has better \"library name priority\" or \"folder name priority\" wins (see Library Name Priority and Folder Name Priority ) A library that is architecture optimized wins against a library that is not architecture optimized (see Architecture Matching ) A library that has a better \"location priority\" wins (see Location Priority ) A library that has a folder name with a better score using the \"closest-match\" algorithm wins A library that has a folder name that comes first in alphanumeric order wins Architecture Matching \u00b6 A library is considered compatible with architecture X if the architectures field in library.properties : explicitly contains the architecture X contains the catch-all * is not specified at all. A library is considered optimized for architecture X only if the architectures field in library.properties explicitly contains the architecture X . This means that a library that is optimized for architecture X is also compatible with it. Examples: architectures field in library.properties Compatible with avr Optimized for avr not specified YES NO architectures=* YES NO architectures=avr YES YES architectures=*,avr YES YES architectures=*,esp8266 YES NO architectures=avr,esp8266 YES YES architectures=samd NO NO Library Name Priority \u00b6 A library's name is defined by the library.properties name field. That value is sanitized by replacing spaces with _ before comparing it to the file name of the include. The \"library name priority\" is determined as follows (in order of highest to lowest priority): Rule Example for Arduino_Low_Power.h The library name matches the include 100% Arduino Low Power The library name matches the include 100%, except with a -master suffix Arduino Low Power-master The library name has a matching prefix Arduino Low Power Whatever The library name has a matching suffix Awesome Arduino Low Power The library name contains the include The Arduino Low Power Lib Folder Name Priority \u00b6 The \"folder name priority\" is determined as follows (in order of highest to lowest priority): Rule Example for Servo.h The folder name matches the include 100% Servo The folder name matches the include 100%, except with a -master suffix Servo-master The folder name has a matching prefix ServoWhatever The folder name has a matching suffix AwesomeServo The folder name contains the include AnAwesomeServoForWhatever Location Priority \u00b6 The \"location priority\" is determined as follows (in order of highest to lowest priority): The library is under a custom libraries path specified via the --libraries option of arduino-cli compile (in decreasing order of priority when multiple custom paths are defined) The library is under the libraries subfolder of the IDE's sketchbook or Arduino CLI's user directory The library is bundled with the board platform/core ( {runtime.platform.path}/libraries ) The library is bundled with the referenced board platform/core The library is bundled with the Arduino IDE (this location is determined by the Arduino CLI configuration setting directories.builtin.libraries ) Location priorities in Arduino Web Editor \u00b6 The location priorities system works in the same manner in Arduino Web Editor , but its cloud-based nature may make the locations of libraries less obvious. Custom : the imported libraries, shown under the Libraries > Custom tab. These libraries are under /tmp/\\<some number>/custom Pinned : libraries that were associated with the sketch by choosing a specific version from the library's \"Include\" dropdown menu. These libraries are under /tmp/\\<some number>/pinned Note: clicking the \"Include\" button does not result in the library being pinned to the sketch. Platform bundled : these are listed under the Libraries > Default tab, but with \"for \\<architecture name>\" appended to the library name (e.g., \"SPI for AVR\").

Libraries listed under Libraries > Library Manager . These libraries are under /home/builder/opt/libraries/latest Compilation \u00b6 Sketches are compiled by architecture-specific versions of gcc and g++ according to the variables in the boards.txt file of the selected board's platform . The sketch is built in a temporary directory in the system-wide temporary directory (e.g. /tmp on Linux). Files taken as source files for the build process are .S, .c and .cpp files (including the .cpp file generated from the sketch's .ino and .pde files during the sketch pre-processing step). Source files of the target are compiled and output with .o extensions to this build directory, as are the main sketch files and any other source files in the sketch and any source files in any libraries which are #include d in the sketch. Before compiling a source file, an attempt is made to reuse the previously compiled .o file, which speeds up the build process. A special .d (dependency) file provides a list of all other files included by the source. The compile step is skipped if the .o and .d files exist and have timestamps newer than the source and all the dependent files. If the source or any dependent file has been modified, or any error occurs verifying the files, the compiler is run normally, writing a new .o & .d file. After a new board is selected from the IDE's Board menu, all source files are rebuilt on the next compile. These .o files are then linked together into a static library and the main sketch file is linked against this library. Only the parts of the library needed for your sketch are included in the final .hex file, reducing the size of most sketches. The .hex file is the final output of the compilation which is then uploaded to the board. If verbose output during compilation is enabled, the complete command line of each external command executed as part of the build process will be printed in the console. Uploading \u00b6 Sketches are uploaded by a platform-specific upload tool (e.g., avrdude). The upload process is also controlled by variables in the boards and main preferences files. See the Arduino platform specification page for details. If verbose output during upload is enabled, debugging information will be output to the console, including the upload tool's command lines and verbose output.","title":"Sketch build process"},{"location":"sketch-build-process/#overview","text":"A number of things have to happen for your Arduino code to get onto the Arduino board. First, the Arduino development software performs some minor pre-processing to turn your sketch into a C++ program. Next, dependencies of the sketch are located. It then gets passed to a compiler (e.g, avr-gcc ), which turns the human readable code into machine readable instructions (or object files). Then your code gets combined with (linked against) the standard Arduino libraries that provide basic functions like digitalWrite() or Serial.print() . The result is a single Intel hex file, which contains the specific bytes that need to be written to the program memory of the chip on the Arduino board.

To work around this, you can provide your own prototypes for these functions. #line directives are added to make warning or error messages reflect the original sketch layout. No pre-processing is done to files in a sketch with any extension other than .ino or .pde. Additionally, .h files in the sketch are not automatically #included from the main sketch file.

The programs that run on Arduino boards are called \"sketches\". This term was inherited from Processing , upon which the Arduino IDE and the core API were based. Sketch folders and files \u00b6 The sketch root folder name and code file names must start with a basic letter ( A - Z or a - z ), number ( 0 - 9 ) 1 , or underscore ( _ ) 2 followed by basic letters, numbers, underscores, dots ( . ) and dashes ( - ). The maximum length is 63 characters. 1 Supported from Arduino IDE 1.8.4. 2 Supported in all versions except Arduino IDE 2.0.4/Arduino CLI 0.30.0 - 0.30.1. Sketch root folder \u00b6 Because many Arduino sketches only contain a single .ino file, it's easy to think of that file as the sketch. However, it is the folder that is the sketch. The reason is that sketches may consist of multiple code files and the folder is what groups those files into a single program. Primary sketch file \u00b6 Every sketch must contain a .ino file with a file name matching the sketch root folder name. .pde is also supported but deprecated and will be removed in the future, using the .ino extension is strongly recommended. Additional code files \u00b6 Sketches may consist of multiple code files. The following extensions are supported: .ino - Arduino language files. .pde - Alternate extension for Arduino language files. This file extension is also used by Processing sketches. .ino is recommended to avoid confusion. .pde extension is deprecated and will be removed in the future. .cpp - C++ files. .c - C Files. .S - Assembly language files. .h, .hpp, .hh 1 - Header files. .tpp, .ipp 2 - Header files. 1 .hpp and .hh supported from Arduino IDE 1.8.0/arduino-builder 1.3.22. 2 Supported from Arduino CLI 0.19.0. For information about how each of these files and other parts of the sketch are used during compilation, see the Sketch build process documentation . src subfolder \u00b6 The contents of the src subfolder are compiled recursively. Unlike the code files in the sketch root folder, these files are not shown as tabs in the IDEs. This is useful for files you don't want to expose to the sketch user via the IDE's interface. It can be used to bundle libraries with the sketch in order to make it a self-contained project. Arduino language files under the src folder are not supported. In Arduino IDE 1.6.5-r5 and older, no recursive compilation was done. In Arduino IDE 1.6.6 - 1.6.9, recursive compilation was done of all subfolders of the sketch folder. In Arduino IDE 1.6.10 and newer, recursive compilation is limited to the src subfolder of the sketch folder. data subfolder \u00b6 The data folder is used to add additional files to the sketch, which will not be compiled. Files added to the sketch via the Arduino IDE's Sketch > Add File... are placed in the data folder. The Arduino IDE's File > Save As... only copies the code files in the sketch root folder and the full contents of the data folder, so any non-code files outside the data folder are stripped. Metadata \u00b6 sketch.json \u00b6 Arduino Web Editor uses a file named sketch.json , located in the sketch root folder, to store sketch metadata. This file is not used by Arduino CLI or Arduino IDE, if you're not an Arduino Web Editor user you can safely ignore the file. The cpu key contains the board configuration information. This can be set by selecting a board in the Arduino Web Editor while the sketch is open. The included_libs key defines the library versions the Arduino Web Editor uses when the sketch is compiled. This is Arduino Web Editor specific because all versions of all the Library Manager libraries are pre-installed in Arduino Web Editor, while only one version of each library may be installed when using the other Arduino development software. Sketch project file \u00b6 This is an optional file named sketch.yaml , located in the root folder of the sketch. Inside the sketch project file the user can define one or more \"profiles\": each profile is a description of all the resources needed to build the sketch (platform and libraries each pinned to a specific version). The sketch project file is also used in the arduino-cli board attach command to store the currently selected board and port. For more information see the sketch project file documentation. Secrets \u00b6 Arduino Web Editor has a \"Secret tab\" feature that makes it easy to share sketches without accidentally exposing sensitive data (e.g., passwords or tokens). The Arduino Web Editor automatically generates macros for any identifier in the sketch which starts with SECRET_ and contains all uppercase characters. When you download a sketch from Arduino Web Editor that contains a Secret tab, the empty #define directives for the secrets are in a file named arduino_secrets.h, with an #include directive to that file at the top of the primary sketch file. This is hidden when viewing the sketch in Arduino Web Editor. Documentation \u00b6 Image and text files in common formats which are present in the sketch root folder are displayed in tabs in the Arduino Web Editor. Sketch file structure example \u00b6 Foo |_ arduino_secrets.h |_ Abc.ino |_ Def.cpp |_ Def.h |_ Foo.ino |_ Ghi.c |_ Ghi.h |_ Jkl.h |_ Jkl.S |_ sketch.yaml |_ data | |_ Schematic.pdf |_ src |_ SomeLib |_ library.properties |_ src |_ SomeLib.h |_ SomeLib.cpp Sketchbook \u00b6 The Arduino IDE provides a \"sketchbook\" folder (analogous to Arduino CLI's \"user directory\"). In addition to being the place where user libraries and manually installed platforms are installed, the sketchbook is a convenient place to store sketches.

A URI in a comment in the form: http://boardsmanager[/TYPE_FILTER][#SEARCH_KEYWORDS] will open a search in Boards Manager when clicked in the Arduino IDE. These links can be used to offer the user an easy way to install dependencies of the sketch. The search field will be populated with the SEARCH_KEYWORDS fragment component of the URI. Any characters other than A - Z , a - z , 0 - 9 , and : are treated as spaces by the search algorithm, which allows multiple keywords to be specified via the URI. (available in Arduino IDE >=2.0.1) The \" Type \" filter will be set to the optional TYPE_FILTER path component of the URI. The Library Manager \" Topic \" filter will be set to the optional TOPIC_FILTER path component of the URI. Unlike the SEARCH_KEYWORDS fragment, spaces and reserved characters in these components must be percent-encoded (e.g., Signal%20Input%2FOutput ). Although the filter setting is not supported by previous IDE versions, URIs containing these path components still function in all other respects. This feature is only available when using the Arduino IDE, so be sure to provide supplementary documentation to help the users of other development software install the sketch dependencies.
