This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose improvements or fix a bug, feel free to submit a PR. Legal requirements \u00b6 Before we can accept your contributions you have to sign the Contributor License Agreement Pull Requests \u00b6 In order to ease code reviews and have your contributions merged faster, here is a list of items you can check before submitting a PR: Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern. PR titles indirectly become part of the CHANGELOG so it's crucial to provide a good record of what change is being made in the title; why it was made will go in the PR description, along with a link to a GitHub issue if it exists. Write tests for the code you wrote. Open your PR against the master branch. Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages . PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and require a lot of work to be merged. Your PR must pass all CI tests before we will merge it. If you're seeing an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change you are making. Prerequisites \u00b6 To build the Arduino CLI from sources you need the following tools to be available in your local environment: Go version 1.12 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line If you want to run integration tests you will also need: A serial port with an Arduino board attached A working Python environment, version 3.8 or later If you're working on the gRPC interface you will also have to: download the protoc compiler run go get -u github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go Building the source code \u00b6 From the project folder root, just run: task build The project uses Go modules so dependencies will be downloaded automatically. At the end of the build, you should find an arduino-cli executable in the same folder. Running the tests \u00b6 There are several checks and test suites in place to ensure the code works as expected and is written in a way that's consistent across the whole codebase. To avoid pushing changes that will cause the CI system to fail, you can run most of the tests locally. To ensure code style is consistent, run: task check To run unit tests: task test-unit To run integration tests (these will take some time and require special setup, see following paragraph): task test-integration Running only some tests \u00b6 By default, all tests from all go packages are run. To run only unit tests from one or more specific packages, you can set the TARGETS environment variable, e.g.: TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task test-unit Alternatively, to run only some specific test(s), you can specify a regex to match against the test function name: TEST_REGEX='^TestTryBuild.*' task test-unit Both can be combined as well, typically to run only a specific test: TEST_REGEX='^TestFindBoardWithFQBN$' TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task test-unit Integration tests \u00b6 Being a command line interface, Arduino CLI is heavily interactive and it has to stay consistent in accepting the user input and providing the expected output and proper exit codes. On top of this, many Arduino CLI features involve communicating with external devices, most likely through a serial port, so unit tests can only go so far in giving us confidence that the code is working. For these reasons, in addition to regular unit tests the project has a suite of integration tests that actually run Arduino CLI in a different process and assess the options are correctly understood and the output is what we expect. Hardware requirements for running the full suite of integration tests: \u00b6 An Arduino board attached to a serial port. The board must: Use one of the VID/PID pairs used by Arduino or their partners (as is the case with all modern official Arduino boards except the classic Nano). Accept uploads using the FQBN associated with that VID/PID (which will be the case unless you have installed a custom bootloader or removed the bootloader). Note that running the integration tests will result in a sketch being uploaded to every attached Arduino board meeting the above requirements. Software requirements for running integration tests: \u00b6 A working Python environment. Chances are that you already have Python installed in your system, if this is not the case you can download the official distribution or use the package manager provided by your Operating System. Some dependencies need to be installed before running the tests and to avoid polluting your global Python environment with dependencies that might be only used by the Arduino CLI, to do so we use Poetry . First you need to install it (you might need to sudo the following command): pip3 install --user poetry For more installation options read the official documentation . After Poetry has been installed you should be able to run the tests with: task test-integration This will automatically install the necessary dependencies, if not already installed, and run the integration tests automatically. When editing any Python file in the project remember to run linting checks with: task python:check This will run flake8 automatically and return any error in the code formatting, if not already installed it will also install integration tests dependencies. In case of linting errors you should be able to solve most of them by automatically formatting with: task python:format Configuration files formatting \u00b6 To keep the configurations tidy and in order we use Prettier to automatically format all YAML files in the project. Keeping and enforcing a formatting standard helps everyone make small PRs and avoids the introduction of formatting changes made by unconfigured editors. There are several ways to run Prettier. If you're using Visual Studio Code you can easily use the prettier-vscode extension to automatically format as you write. Otherwise you can use the following tasks. To do so you'll need to install npm if not already installed. Check the official documentation to learn how to install npm for your platform. To check if the files are correctly formatted run: task config:check If the output tells you that some files are not formatted correctly run: task config:format When opening a new Pull Request, checks are automatically run to verify that configuration files are correctly formatted. In case of failures we might ask you to update the PR with correct formatting. Working on docs \u00b6 Documentation is provided to final users in form of static HTML content generated from a tool called MkDocs and hosted on GitHub Pages . Local development \u00b6 Most of the documentation consists of static content written over several Markdown files under the docs folder at the root of this git repository but some other content is dynamically generated from the CI pipelines - this is the case with the command line reference and the gRPC interface, for example. If you want to check out how the documentation would look after some local changes, you might need to reproduce what happens in the CI, generating the full documentation website from your personal computer. To run the docs toolchain locally, you need to have a few dependencies and tools installed: Go version 1.12 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line A working Python environment, see this paragraph if you need to setup one Before running the toolchain, perform the following operations from the root of the git repository (if you have a Python virtual environment, activate it before proceeding): go get -u github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc pip install -r requirements_docs.txt When working on docs, you can launch a command that will take care of generating the docs, build the static website and start a local server you can later access with a web browser to see a preview of your changes. From the root of the git repository run: task docs:serve If you don't see any error, hit http://127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser to navigate the generated docs. Docs publishing \u00b6 The present git repository has a special branch called gh-pages that contains the generated HTML code for the docs website; every time a change is pushed to this special branch, GitHub automatically triggers a deployment to pull the change and publish a new version of the website. Do not open Pull Requests to push changes to the gh-pages branch, that will be done exclusively from the CI. Docs versioning \u00b6 In order to provide support for multiple Arduino CLI releases, Documentation is versioned so that visitors can select which version of the documentation website should be displayed. Unfortunately this feature isn't provided by GitHub pages or MkDocs, so we had to implement it on top of the generation process. Before delving into the details of the generation process, here follow some requirements that were established to provide versioned documentation: A special version of the documentation called dev is provided to reflect the status of the Arduino CLI on the master branch - this includes unreleased features and bugfixes. Docs are versioned after the minor version of an Arduino CLI release. For example, Arduino CLI 0.99.1 and 0.99.2 will be both covered by documentation version 0.99 . The landing page of the documentation website will automatically redirect visitors to the most recently released version of the Arduino CLI. To implement the requirements above, the execution of MkDocs is wrapped using a CLI tool called Mike that does a few things for us: It runs MkDocs targeting subfolders named after the Arduino CLI version, e.g. documentation for version 0.10.1 can be found under the folder 0.10 . It injects an HTML control into the documentation website that lets visitors choose which version of the docs to browse from a dropdown list. It provides a redirect to a version we decide when visitors hit the landing page of the documentation website. It pushes generated contents to the gh-pages branch. Note: unless you're working on the generation process itself, you should never run Mike from a local environment, either directly or through the Task docs:publish . This might result in unwanted changes to the public website. Docs formatting \u00b6 To keep the documentation tidy and in order we use Prettier to automatically format all Markdown files in the project. Keeping and enforcing a formatting standard helps everyone make small PRs and avoids the introduction of formatting changes made by unconfigured editors. There are several ways to run Prettier. If you're using Visual Studio Code you can easily use the prettier-vscode extension to automatically format as you write. Otherwise you can use the following tasks. To do so you'll need to install npm if not already installed. Check the official documentation to learn how to install npm for your platform. To check if the files are correctly formatted run: task docs:check If the output tells you that some files are not formatted correctly run: task docs:format When opening a new Pull Request, checks are automatically run to verify that documentation is correctly formatted. In case of failures we might ask you to update the PR with correct formatting. Docs automation \u00b6 In order to avoid unwanted changes to the public website hosting the Arduino CLI documentation, only Mike is allowed to push changes to the gh-pages branch, and this only happens from within the CI, in a workflow named publish-docs . The CI is responsible for guessing which version of the Arduino CLI we're building docs for, so that generated content will be stored in the appropriate section of the documentation website. Because this guessing might be fairly complex, the logic is implemented in a Python script called build.py . The script will determine the version of the Arduino CLI that was modified in the current commit (either dev or an official, numbered release) and whether the redirect to the latest version that happens on the landing page should be updated or not. Internationalization (i18n) \u00b6 In order to support i18n in the CLI, any messages that are intended to be translated should be wrapped in a call to i18n.Tr . This call allows us to build a catalog of translatable strings, replacing the reference string at runtime with the localized value. Adding or modifying these messages requires an i18n update, as this process creates the reference catalog that is shared with translators. For that reason, the task check command will fail if the catalog was not updated to sync with changes to the source code. To update the catalog, execute the following command and commit the changes. task i18n:update To verify that the catalog is up-to-date, you may execute the command: task i18n:check Example usage: package main import ( \"fmt\" \"github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/i18n\" ) func main() { fmt.Println(i18n.Tr(\"Hello World!\")) } Additional settings \u00b6 If you need to push a commit that's only shipping documentation changes or example files, thus a complete no-op for the test suite, please start the commit message with the string [skip ci] to skip the build and give that slot to someone else who does need it. If your PR doesn't need to be included in the changelog, please start the PR title with the string [skip changelog]","title":"How to contribute"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute","text":"First of all, thanks for contributing!

Let's see some examples. Before you start \u00b6 arduino-cli is a container of commands and each command has its own dedicated help text that can be shown with the help command like this: $ arduino-cli help core Arduino Core operations. Usage: arduino-cli core [command] Examples: ./arduino-cli core update-index Available Commands: download Downloads one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. install Installs one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. list Shows the list of installed platforms. search Search for a core in the package index. uninstall Uninstalls one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies if no more used. update-index Updates the index of cores. upgrade Upgrades one or all installed platforms to the latest version.

(default \"text\") --log-file string Path to the file where logs will be written. --log-format string The output format for the logs, can be [text|json]. --log-level string Messages with this level and above will be logged. -v, --verbose Print the logs on the standard output. Use \"arduino-cli core [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Create a configuration file \u00b6 Arduino CLI doesn't strictly require a configuration file to work because the command line interface provides any possible functionality. However, having one can spare you a lot of typing when issuing a command, so let's go ahead and create it with: $ arduino-cli config init Config file written: /home/luca/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml If you inspect the contents of arduino-cli.yaml , you'll find the available options with their respective default values. For more information, see the configuration documentation . Create a new sketch \u00b6 To create a new sketch named MyFirstSketch in the current directory, run the following command: $ arduino-cli sketch new MyFirstSketch Sketch created in: /home/luca/MyFirstSketch A sketch is a folder containing assets like source files and libraries; the new command creates for you a .ino file called MyFirstSketch.ino containing Arduino boilerplate code: $ cat $HOME /MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino void setup () { } void loop () { } At this point you can use your favourite file editor or IDE to open the file $HOME/MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino and change the code like this: void setup () { pinMode ( LED_BUILTIN , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } Connect the board to your PC \u00b6 The first thing to do upon a fresh install is to update the local cache of available platforms and libraries by running: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded After connecting the board to your PC by using the USB cable, you should be able to check whether it's been recognized by running: $ arduino-cli board list Port Type Board Name FQBN Core /dev/ttyACM1 Serial Port ( USB ) Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 arduino:samd In this example, the MKR1000 board was recognized and from the output of the command you see the platform core called arduino:samd is the one that needs to be installed to make it work. If you see an Unknown board listed, uploading should still work as long as you identify the platform core and use the correct FQBN string. When a board is not detected for whatever reason, you can list all the supported boards and their FQBN strings by running the following: $ arduino-cli board listall mkr Board Name FQBN Arduino MKR FOX 1200 arduino:samd:mkrfox1200 Arduino MKR GSM 1400 arduino:samd:mkrgsm1400 Arduino MKR WAN 1300 arduino:samd:mkrwan1300 Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 arduino:samd:mkrwifi1010 Arduino MKRZERO arduino:samd:mkrzero Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 Install the core for your board \u00b6 To install the arduino:samd platform core, run the following: $ arduino-cli core install arduino:samd Downloading tools... arduino:arm-none-eabi-gcc@4.8.3-2014q1 downloaded arduino:bossac@1.7.0 downloaded arduino:openocd@0.9.0-arduino6-static downloaded arduino:CMSIS@4.5.0 downloaded arduino:CMSIS-Atmel@1.1.0 downloaded arduino:arduinoOTA@1.2.0 downloaded Downloading cores... arduino:samd@1.6.19 downloaded Installing tools...

Now we are ready to compile and upload the sketch. Adding 3 rd party cores \u00b6 If your board requires 3 rd party core packages to work, you can list the URLs to additional package indexes in the Arduino CLI configuration file. For example, to add the ESP8266 core, edit the configuration file and change the board_manager settings as follows: board_manager : additional_urls : - https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json From now on, commands supporting custom cores will automatically use the additional URL from the configuration file: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Alternatively, you can pass a link to the additional package index file with the --additional-urls option, that has to be specified every time and for every command that operates on a 3 rd party platform core, for example: $ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Compile and upload the sketch \u00b6 To compile the sketch you run the compile command, passing the proper FQBN string: $ arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch Sketch uses 9600 bytes ( 3 % ) of program storage space. Maximum is 262144 bytes. To upload the sketch to your board, run the following command, using the serial port your board is connected to: $ arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch No new serial port detected.

But don\u2019t get fooled by its name: Arduino CLI can do much more than the average console application, as shown by the Arduino Pro IDE and Arduino Create , which rely on it for similar purposes but each one in a completely different way from the other. In this article we introduce the three pillars of the Arduino CLI, explaining how we designed the software so that it can be effectively leveraged under different scenarios. The first pillar: command line interface \u00b6 Console applications for humans \u00b6 As you might expect, the first way to use the Arduino CLI is from a terminal and by a human, and user experience plays a key role here. The UX is under a continuous improvement process as we want the tool to be powerful without being too complicated. We heavily rely on sub-commands to provide a rich set of different operations logically grouped together, so that users can easily explore the interface while getting very specific contextual help. Console applications for robots \u00b6 Humans are not the only type of customers we want to support and the Arduino CLI was also designed to be used programmatically - think about automation pipelines or a CI / CD system. There are some niceties to observe when you write software that\u2019s supposed to be easy to run when unattended and one in particular is the ability to run without a configuration file. This is possible because every configuration option you find in the arduino-cli.yaml configuration file can be provided either through a command line flag or by setting an environment variable. To give an example, the following commands are all equivalent and will fetch the package index used to work with unstable experimental versions of Arduino's cores: See the configuration documentation for details about Arduino CLI's configuration system. Consistent with the previous paragraph, when it comes to providing output the Arduino CLI aims to be user friendly but also slightly verbose, something that doesn\u2019t play well with robots. This is why we added an option to provide output that\u2019s easy to parse. For example, the following figure shows what getting the software version in JSON format looks like. Even if not related to software design, one last feature that\u2019s worth mentioning is the availability of a one-line installation script that can be used to make the latest version of the Arduino CLI available on most systems with an HTTP client like curl or wget and a shell like bash. For more information on Arduino CLI's command line interface, see the command reference . The second pillar: gRPC interface \u00b6 gRPC is a high performance RPC framework that can efficiently connect client and server applications. The Arduino CLI can act as a gRPC server (we call it daemon mode ), exposing a set of procedures that implement the very same set of features of the command line interface and waiting for clients to connect and use them. To give an idea, the following is some Golang code capable of retrieving the version number of a remote running Arduino CLI server instance: gRPC is language agnostic: even if the example is written in Golang, the programming language used for the client can be Python, JavaScript or any of the many supported ones , leading to a variety of possible scenarios. The new Arduino Pro IDE is a good example of how to leverage the daemon mode of the Arduino CLI with a clean separation of concerns: the Pro IDE knows nothing about how to download a core, compile a sketch or talk to an Arduino board and it demands all these features of an Arduino CLI instance. Conversely, the Arduino CLI doesn\u2019t even know that the client that\u2019s connected is the Pro IDE, and neither does it care. For more information on Arduino CLI's gRPC interface, see the gRPC interface reference . The third pillar: embedding \u00b6 Arduino CLI is written in Golang and the code is organized in a way that makes it easy to use it as a library by including the modules you need in another Golang application at compile time. Both the first and second pillars rely on a common Golang API, a set of functions that abstract all the functionalities offered by the Arduino CLI, so that when we provide a fix or a new feature, they are automatically available to both the command line and gRPC interfaces. The source modules implementing this API can be imported in other Golang programs to embed a full-fledged Arduino CLI. For example, this is how some backend services powering Arduino Create can compile sketches and manage libraries. Just to give you a taste of what it means to embed the Arduino CLI, here is how to search for a core using the API: Embedding the Arduino CLI is limited to Golang applications and requires a deep knowledge of its internals. For the average use case, the gRPC interface might be a better alternative. Nevertheless, this remains a valid option that we use and provide support for. Conclusions \u00b6 You can start playing with the Arduino CLI right away. The code is open source and the repo contains example code showing how to implement a gRPC client . If you\u2019re curious about how we designed the low level API, have a look at the commands package and don\u2019t hesitate to leave feedback on the issue tracker if you\u2019ve got a use case that doesn\u2019t fit one of the three pillars.","title":"Integration options"},{"location":"integration-options/#the-three-pillars-of-the-arduino-cli","text":"The Arduino CLI is an open source Command Line Application written in Golang that can be used from a terminal to compile, verify and upload sketches to Arduino boards and that\u2019s capable of managing all the software and tools needed in the process.

The Library Manager allows users to automatically download and install libraries needed in their projects, with an easy to use graphical interface in the Arduino IDE /Pro IDE and Arduino Web Editor as well as arduino-cli lib . More information about how Library Manager works is available here . Arduino development software supports multiple microcontroller architectures (e.g. AVR, SAM, etc), meaning that libraries may need to work on multiple architectures. The new 1.5 library format doesn\u2019t contain special support for cross-architecture libraries, but it does provide a preprocessor based mechanism for libraries to target sections of code to specific architectures. See also \u00b6 Arduino library style guide Library dependency resolution process documentation 1.5 library format (rev. 2.2) \u00b6 Library metadata \u00b6 The most significant addition to the format is the ability to add information about the library itself through a properties file called library.properties . This file allows the Library Manager to search and install a library and its dependencies in an easy and automated way. It must be located in the root of the library folder. library.properties file format \u00b6 The library.properties file is a key=value properties list. Every field in this file is UTF-8 encoded. Unless noted otherwise below, all fields are required . The available fields are: name - the name of the library. Library names must contain only basic letters (A-Z or a-z) and numbers (0-9), spaces ( ), underscores (_), dots (.) and dashes (-). They cannot start with a number. Note that libraries with a name value starting with Arduino will no longer be allowed addition to the Library Manager index as these names are now reserved for official Arduino libraries. version - version of the library. Version should be semver compliant. 1.2.0 is correct; 1.2 is accepted; r5, 003, 1.1c are invalid author - name/nickname of the authors and their email addresses (not mandatory) separated by comma (,) maintainer - name and email of the maintainer sentence - a sentence explaining the purpose of the library paragraph - a longer description of the library. The value of sentence will be prepended to this, so you should start by writing the second sentence here category - (defaults to Uncategorized ) allowed values: Display Communication Signal Input/Output Sensors Device Control Timing Data Storage Data Processing Other url - the URL of the library project, for a person to visit. For example, the library's GitHub page. This is used for the \"More info\" links in Library Manager architectures - (defaults to * ) a comma separated list of architectures supported by the library. If the library doesn\u2019t contain architecture specific code use * to match all architectures. This field is used as one factor in determining priority when multiple libraries match an #include directive and to provide a warning message when the library is compiled for a board of an architecture that doesn't match any on the list. depends - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.10/Arduino CLI 0.7.0) (optional) a comma-separated list of dependencies (libraries that are needed to build the current library). The Arduino IDE's Library Manager will offer to install the dependencies during installation of the library. arduino-cli lib install will automatically install the dependencies. Since spaces are allowed in the name of a library, but not commas, you can refer to libraries containing spaces in the name without ambiguity for example: depends=Very long library name, Another library with long-name dot_a_linkage - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.0 / arduino-builder 1.0.0-beta13) (optional) when set to true , the library will be compiled using a .a (archive) file. First, all source files are compiled into .o files as normal. Then instead of including all .o files in the linker command directly, all .o files are saved into a .a file, which is then included in the linker command. 1.5 format library folder structure is required. includes - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.10) (optional) a comma separated list of files to be added to the sketch as #include <...> lines. This property is used with the \"Include library\" command in the Arduino IDE. If the includes property is missing, all the header files (.h) on the root source folder are included. precompiled - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) enables support for .a (archive) and .so (shared object) files. See the \"Precompiled binaries\" section for documentation of the required location in the library for these files. The static library should be linked as an ldflag. The precompiled field has two supported values, which control how any source files in the library are handled: true - Source files are always compiled. This is useful for \"mixed\" libraries, such as those that contain both open source code and the precompiled binary of a closed source component. Support for \"mixed\" libraries was inadvertently lost in Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0, and returned in Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0. full - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If the library provides a precompiled library for the board being compiled for, the source files will not be compiled. If no precompiled library was provided for the selected board, source files are compiled as a fallback. This is useful for precompiling the library to reduce compilation time for specific target hardware, but also providing support for arbitrary boards by compiling the library on demand. ldflags - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) the linker flags to be added. Ex: ldflags=-lm Example: name=WebServer version=1.0.0 author=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com>, Pippo Pluto <pippo@example.com> maintainer=Cristian Maglie <c.maglie@example.com> sentence=A library that makes coding a Webserver a breeze. paragraph=Supports HTTP1.1 and you can do GET and POST. category=Communication url=http://example.com/ architectures=avr includes=WebServer.h depends=ArduinoHttpClient Layout of folders and files \u00b6 Each folder has a specific purpose (sources, examples, documentation, etc). Folders not covered in this specification may be added as needed to future revisions. Library Root folder \u00b6 The library root folder name must start with a basic letter (A-Z or a-z) or number (0-9), followed by basic letters, numbers, spaces ( ), underscores (_), dots (.) and dashes (-). The maximum length is 63 characters. Source code \u00b6 For libraries intended to be used with Arduino IDE 1.5.x+ only, the source code resides in the src folder. For example: Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp The source code found in src folder and all its subfolders is compiled and linked in the user\u2019s sketch. Only the src folder is added to the include search path (both when compiling the sketch and the library). When the user imports a library into their sketch (from the Arduino IDE's \"Sketch > Include Library\" menu or the Arduino Web Editor's \"Include\" button), the default behavior (configurable via the library.properties includes field ) is for an #include statement to be added for all header (.h) files in the src/ directory (but not its subfolders). As a result, these header files form something of a de facto interface to your library; in general, the only header files in the root src/ folder should be those that you want to expose to the user's sketch and plan to maintain compatibility with in future versions of the library. Place internal header files in a subfolder of the src/ folder. For backward compatibility with Arduino IDE 1.0.x, the library author may opt to place source code into the root folder, instead of the folder called src . In this case the 1.0 library format is applied and the source code is searched from the library root folder and the utility folder, for example: Servo/Servo.h Servo/Servo.cpp Servo/utility/ServoTimers.h Servo/utility/ServoTimers.cpp This will allow existing 1.0 format libraries to compile under Arduino IDE 1.5.x+ as well, and vice-versa. If a library only needs to run on Arduino IDE 1.5.x+, we recommend placing all source code in the src/ folder. If a library requires recursive compilation of nested source folders, its code must be in the src/ folder (since Arduino IDE 1.0.x doesn\u2019t support recursive compilation, backwards compatibility wouldn\u2019t be possible anyway). Precompiled binaries \u00b6 The precompiled field of library.properties enables support for the use of precompiled libraries. This requires providing .a (archive) or .so (shared object) files which are compiled for a particular processor architecture. The target architecture of the files is indicated by folder names. The binaries must be located at src/{build.mcu} , where {build.mcu} is the architecture name of the target the file was compiled for. Ex: cortex-m3 for the Arduino Due. The filenames of the compiled binaries should start with lib (e.g., libFoo.a ). (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0) The floating point ABI configuration of ARM core microcontrollers may be adjusted via compiler flags. An extra subfolder level can be used to provide files compiled for a specific floating point configuration: src/{build.mcu}/{build.fpu}-{build.float-abi} , where {build.fpu} is the value of the -mfpu compiler flag and {build.float-abi} is the value of the -mfloat-abi compiler flag. (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If floating point configuration flags are used but no folder matching that configuration is found, src/{build.mcu} is used as a fallback. Below is an example library src folder structure that provides: Header file containing the declarations for the library API. Source file to use as a fallback for other architectures ( precompiled=full mode). Archive file for the ARM Cortex M0+ architecture of the Arduino SAMD boards. Archive file for the ARM Cortex M4 architecture of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, as a fallback for backwards compatibility with Arduino development software before the floating point configuration support was added. Archive file for the ARM Cortex M4 architecture of the Arduino Nano 33 BLE, compiled for the -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 floating point ABI configuration. Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp Servo/src/cortex-m0plus/libServo.a Servo/src/cortex-m4/libServo.a Servo/src/cortex-m4/fpv4-sp-d16-softfp/libServo.a Library Examples \u00b6 Library examples must be placed in the examples folder. Note that the examples folder name must be written exactly like that (with lower case letters). Servo/examples/... Sketches contained inside the examples folder will be shown in the Examples menu of the Arduino IDE and Arduino Web Editor. More information: Arduino sketch specification Style guide for Arduino examples Extra documentation \u00b6 An extras folder can be used by the developer to put documentation or other items to be bundled with the library. Remember that files placed inside this folder will increase the size of the library, so putting a 20MB PDF in a library that weights a few kilobytes may not be such a good idea. The content of the extras folder is totally ignored by the Arduino development software; you are free to put anything inside. Keywords \u00b6 A list of keywords for the library may be specified in a file named keywords.txt located in the root of the library folder. When a keyword of any installed library is used in a sketch the Arduino IDE colors it. Servo/keywords.txt An example keywords.txt file: # Syntax Coloring Map For ExampleLibrary # Datatypes (KEYWORD1) Test KEYWORD1 # Methods and Functions (KEYWORD2) doSomething KEYWORD2 # Instances (KEYWORD2) # Constants (LITERAL1) This file would cause the Arduino IDE to highlight Test as a data type, and doSomething as a method / function. keywords.txt format \u00b6 keywords.txt is formatted in four fields which are separated by a single true tab (not spaces): KEYWORD KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE REFERENCE_LINK RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE It is permitted to leave a field empty.

Generally it does not make sense to define the REFERENCE_LINK field for 3 rd party library keywords since they are not likely to be in the Arduino Language Reference. RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE \u00b6 In Arduino IDE 1.6.5 and newer this field overrides KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE . In previous IDE versions the RSYNTAXTEXTAREA_TOKENTYPE field is ignored and KEYWORD_TOKENTYPE is used instead.

This is to prevent users from accidentally modifying example sketches. During the library development process you may want to edit example sketches in place using the Arduino IDE. With Arduino IDE 1.6.6 and newer, the read-only behavior can be disabled by adding a file named .development to the root of the library folder. A library.properties file must also be present. The Library Manager indexer will not pick up releases that contain a .development file so be sure not to push this file to your remote repository. A complete example \u00b6 A hypothetical library named \"Servo\" that adheres to the specification follows: Servo/ Servo/library.properties Servo/keywords.txt Servo/src/ Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp Servo/src/ServoTimers.h Servo/examples/ Servo/examples/Sweep/Sweep.ino Servo/examples/Pot/Pot.ino Servo/extras/ Servo/extras/Servo_Connectors.pdf Working with multiple architectures \u00b6 Libraries placed in the libraries subfolder of the sketchbook folder (AKA \"user directory\") will be made available for all boards, which may include multiple different processor architectures. To provide architecture-specific code or optimizations, library authors can use the ARDUINO_ARCH_XXX preprocessor macro ( #define ), where XXX is the name of the architecture (as determined by the name of the architecture folder of the board's platform). For example, ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR will be defined when compiling for AVR-based boards. An example: #if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR) // AVR-specific code #elif defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_SAM) // SAM-specific code #else // generic, non-platform specific code #endif Alternatively, if a library only works on certain architectures, you can provide an explicit error message (instead of allowing the compilation to fail in a difficult to understand way): #if defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_AVR) // AVR-specific code #elif defined(ARDUINO_ARCH_SAM) // SAM-specific code #else #error \u201cThis library only supports boards with an AVR or SAM processor.\u201d #endif Old library format (pre-1.5) \u00b6 In order to support old libraries (from Arduino IDE 1.0.x), the Arduino IDE/Pro IDE and Arduino CLI will also compile libraries missing a library.properties metadata file. As a result, these libraries should behave as they did in Arduino IDE 1.0.x, although they will be available for all boards, including non-AVR ones (which wouldn\u2019t have been present in Arduino IDE 1.0.x).","title":"Library specification"},{"location":"library-specification/#see-also","text":"Arduino library style guide Library dependency resolution process documentation","title":"See also"},{"location":"library-specification/#15-library-format-rev-22","text":"","title":"1.5 library format (rev. 2.2)"},{"location":"library-specification/#library-metadata","text":"The most significant addition to the format is the ability to add information about the library itself through a properties file called library.properties .

If the library doesn\u2019t contain architecture specific code use * to match all architectures. This field is used as one factor in determining priority when multiple libraries match an #include directive and to provide a warning message when the library is compiled for a board of an architecture that doesn't match any on the list. depends - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.10/Arduino CLI 0.7.0) (optional) a comma-separated list of dependencies (libraries that are needed to build the current library). The Arduino IDE's Library Manager will offer to install the dependencies during installation of the library. arduino-cli lib install will automatically install the dependencies. Since spaces are allowed in the name of a library, but not commas, you can refer to libraries containing spaces in the name without ambiguity for example: depends=Very long library name, Another library with long-name dot_a_linkage - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.0 / arduino-builder 1.0.0-beta13) (optional) when set to true , the library will be compiled using a .a (archive) file. First, all source files are compiled into .o files as normal. Then instead of including all .o files in the linker command directly, all .o files are saved into a .a file, which is then included in the linker command. 1.5 format library folder structure is required. includes - (available from Arduino IDE 1.6.10) (optional) a comma separated list of files to be added to the sketch as #include <...> lines. This property is used with the \"Include library\" command in the Arduino IDE. If the includes property is missing, all the header files (.h) on the root source folder are included. precompiled - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) enables support for .a (archive) and .so (shared object) files. See the \"Precompiled binaries\" section for documentation of the required location in the library for these files. The static library should be linked as an ldflag. The precompiled field has two supported values, which control how any source files in the library are handled: true - Source files are always compiled. This is useful for \"mixed\" libraries, such as those that contain both open source code and the precompiled binary of a closed source component. Support for \"mixed\" libraries was inadvertently lost in Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0, and returned in Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0. full - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.13/arduino-builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.11.0) If the library provides a precompiled library for the board being compiled for, the source files will not be compiled. If no precompiled library was provided for the selected board, source files are compiled as a fallback. This is useful for precompiling the library to reduce compilation time for specific target hardware, but also providing support for arbitrary boards by compiling the library on demand. ldflags - (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0) (optional) the linker flags to be added.

For example: Servo/src/Servo.h Servo/src/Servo.cpp The source code found in src folder and all its subfolders is compiled and linked in the user\u2019s sketch. Only the src folder is added to the include search path (both when compiling the sketch and the library). When the user imports a library into their sketch (from the Arduino IDE's \"Sketch > Include Library\" menu or the Arduino Web Editor's \"Include\" button), the default behavior (configurable via the library.properties includes field ) is for an #include statement to be added for all header (.h) files in the src/ directory (but not its subfolders). As a result, these header files form something of a de facto interface to your library; in general, the only header files in the root src/ folder should be those that you want to expose to the user's sketch and plan to maintain compatibility with in future versions of the library. Place internal header files in a subfolder of the src/ folder. For backward compatibility with Arduino IDE 1.0.x, the library author may opt to place source code into the root folder, instead of the folder called src . In this case the 1.0 library format is applied and the source code is searched from the library root folder and the utility folder, for example: Servo/Servo.h Servo/Servo.cpp Servo/utility/ServoTimers.h Servo/utility/ServoTimers.cpp This will allow existing 1.0 format libraries to compile under Arduino IDE 1.5.x+ as well, and vice-versa. If a library only needs to run on Arduino IDE 1.5.x+, we recommend placing all source code in the src/ folder. If a library requires recursive compilation of nested source folders, its code must be in the src/ folder (since Arduino IDE 1.0.x doesn\u2019t support recursive compilation, backwards compatibility wouldn\u2019t be possible anyway).","title":"Source code"},{"location":"library-specification/#precompiled-binaries","text":"The precompiled field of library.properties enables support for the use of precompiled libraries.

The filenames of the compiled binaries should start with lib (e.g., libFoo.a ). (available from Arduino IDE 1.8.12/arduino-builder 1.5.2/Arduino CLI 0.8.0) The floating point ABI configuration of ARM core microcontrollers may be adjusted via compiler flags. An extra subfolder level can be used to provide files compiled for a specific floating point configuration: src/{build.mcu}/{build.fpu}-{build.float-abi} , where {build.fpu} is the value of the -mfpu compiler flag and {build.float-abi} is the value of the -mfloat-abi compiler flag.

Boards Manager functionality is provided by Arduino CLI , Arduino IDE , and Arduino Pro IDE. Naming of the JSON index file \u00b6 Many different index files coming from different vendors may be in use, so each vendor should name their own index file in a way that won't conflict with others. The file must be named as follows: package_YOURNAME_PACKAGENAME_index.json The prefix package_ and the postfix _index.json are mandatory (otherwise the index file is not recognised by the Arduino development software) while the choice of YOURNAME_PACKAGENAME is left to the packager. We suggest using a domain name owned by the packager. For example: package_arduino.cc_index.json or package_example.com_avr_boards_index.json The index URL is periodically checked for updates, so expect a constant flow of downloads (proportional to the number of active users). JSON Index file contents \u00b6 The root of the JSON index is an array of packages : { \"packages\" : [ PACKAGE_XXXX ] } 3 rd party vendors should use a single PACKAGE_XXXX that is a dictionary map with the vendor's metadata, a list of PLATFORMS and a list of TOOLS . For example: { \"name\" : \"arduino\" , \"maintainer\" : \"Arduino LLC\" , \"websiteURL\" : \"http://www.arduino.cc/\" , \"email\" : \"packages@arduino.cc\" , \"platforms\" : [ PLATFORM_AVR , PLATFORM_ARM , PLATFORM_XXXXX , PLATFORM_YYYYY ], \"tools\" : [ TOOLS_COMPILER_AVR , TOOLS_UPLOADER_AVR , TOOLS_COMPILER_ARM , TOOLS_XXXXXXX , TOOLS_YYYYYYY ] } The metadata fields are: name : the folder used for the installed cores. The vendor folder name of the installed package is determined by this field maintainer : the extended name of the vendor that is displayed on the Arduino IDE/Pro IDE's Boards Manager GUI websiteURL : the URL to the vendor's website, appears on the Arduino IDE/Pro IDE's Boards Manager as a \"More info\" link email : the email of the vendor/maintainer Now, before looking at PLATFORMS , let's explore first how TOOLS are made. Tools definitions \u00b6 Each tool describes a binary distribution of a command line tool. A tool can be: a compiler toolchain an uploader a file preprocessor a debugger a program that performs a firmware upgrade basically anything that can run on the user's host PC and do something useful. For example, Arduino uses two command line tools for the AVR boards: avr-gcc (the compiler) and avrdude (the uploader). Tools are mapped as JSON in this way: { \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"4.8.1-arduino5\" , \"systems\" : [ { \"host\" : \"i386-apple-darwin11\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i386-apple-darwin11.tar.bz2\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i386-apple-darwin11.tar.bz2\" , \"size\" : \"24437400\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:111b3ef00d737d069eb237a8933406cbb928e4698689e24663cffef07688a901\" }, { \"host\" : \"x86_64-linux-gnu\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"size\" : \"27093036\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:9054fcc174397a419ba56c4ce1bfcbcad275a6a080cc144905acc9b0351ee9cc\" }, { \"host\" : \"i686-linux-gnu\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.bz2\" , \"size\" : \"25882375\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:7648b7f549b37191da0b0be53bae791b652f82ac3cb4e7877f85075aaf32141f\" }, { \"host\" : \"i686-mingw32\" , \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/tools/avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i686-mingw32.zip\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5-i686-mingw32.zip\" , \"size\" : \"46044779\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:d4303226a7b41d3c445d901b5aa5903458def3fc7b7ff4ffef37cabeb37d424d\" } ] } , The field name and version are respectively the name and version of the tool. Each tool is uniquely identified by the triple ( packager , name , version ). packager (AKA \"vendor\") is defined by the name value of the tool's package. There can be many different versions of the same tool available at the same time, for example: ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino2 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino3 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino5 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 5.11 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.0 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.1 ) ..... Each tool version may come in different build flavours for different OS. Each flavour is listed under the systems array. In the example above avr-gcc comes with builds for: Linux 64-bit ( x86_64-linux-gnu ), Linux 32-bit ( i686-linux-gnu ), Windows ( i686-mingw32 ), Mac ( i386-apple-darwin11 ) The IDE will take care to install the right flavour based on the host value, or fail if a needed flavour is missing. Note that this information is not used to select the toolchain during compilation. If you want this specific version to be used, you should use the notation {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} in the platform.txt. The other fields are: url : the download URL of the tool's archive archiveFileName : the name of the file saved to disk after the download (some web servers don't provide the filename through the HTTP request) size : the size of the archive in bytes checksum : the checksum of the archive, used to check if the file has been corrupted. The format is ALGORITHM:CHECKSUM , currently MD5 , SHA-1 , SHA-256 algorithm are supported, we recommend SHA-256 . On *nix or macOS you can use the command shasum -a 256 filename to generate SHA-256 checksums. There are free options for Windows, including md5deep. There are also online utilities for generating checksums. How a tool's path is determined in platform.txt \u00b6 When the IDE needs a tool, it downloads the corresponding archive file and unpacks the content into a private folder that can be referenced from platform.txt using one of the following properties: {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME.path} For example, to obtain the avr-gcc 4.8.1 folder we can use {runtime.tools.avr-gcc-4.8.1-arduino5.path} or {runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path} . Platforms definitions \u00b6 Finally, let's see how PLATFORMS are made. { \"name\" : \"Arduino AVR Boards\" , \"architecture\" : \"avr\" , \"version\" : \"1.6.6\" , \"category\" : \"Arduino\" , \"help\" : { \"online\" : \"http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage\" }, \"url\" : \"http://downloads.arduino.cc/cores/avr-1.6.6.tar.bz2\" , \"archiveFileName\" : \"avr-1.6.6.tar.bz2\" , \"checksum\" : \"SHA-256:08ad5db4978ebea22344edc5d77dce0923d8a644da7a14dc8072e883c76058d8\" , \"size\" : \"4876916\" , \"boards\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Arduino Y\u00fan\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Uno\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Diecimila\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Nano\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Mega\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino MegaADK\" }, { \"name\" : \"Arduino Leonardo\" }, ], \"toolsDependencies\" : [ { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avr-gcc\" , \"version\" : \"4.8.1-arduino5\" }, { \"packager\" : \"arduino\" , \"name\" : \"avrdude\" , \"version\" : \"6.0.1-arduino5\" } ] } , Each PLATFORM describes a core for a specific architecture. The fields needed are: name : the extended name of the platform that is displayed on the Boards Manager GUI architecture : is the architecture of the platform (avr, sam, etc...). It must match the architecture of the core as explained in the Arduino platform specification version : the version of the platform. category : this field is reserved, a 3 rd party core must set it to Contributed help / online : is a URL that is displayed on the Arduino IDE's Boards Manager as an \"Online Help\" link url , archiveFileName , size and checksum : metadata of the core archive file. The meaning is the same as for the TOOLS boards : the list of boards supported (note: just the names to display on the Arduino IDE and Arduino Pro IDE's Boards Manager GUI! the real boards definitions are inside boards.txt inside the core archive file) toolsDependencies : the tools needed by this core. They will be installed by Boards Manager along with the platform. Each tool is referenced by the triple ( packager , name , version ) as previously said. Note that you can reference tools available in other packages as well, even if no platform of that package is installed. The version field is validated by both Arduino IDE and JSemVer . Here are the rules Arduino IDE follows for parsing versions ( source ): Split the version at the - character and continue with the first part. If there are no dots ( . ), parse version as an integer and form a Version from that integer using Version.forIntegers If there is one dot, split version into two, parse each part as an integer, and form a Version from those integers using Version.forIntegers Otherwise, simply parse version into a Version using Version.valueOf Note: if you miss a bracket in the JSON index, then add the URL to your Preferences, and open Boards Manager it can cause the Arduino IDE to no longer load until you have deleted the file from your arduino15 folder.

Each tool is uniquely identified by the triple ( packager , name , version ). packager (AKA \"vendor\") is defined by the name value of the tool's package. There can be many different versions of the same tool available at the same time, for example: ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino2 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino3 ) ( arduino , avr-gcc , 4.8.1-arduino5 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 5.11 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.0 ) ( arduino , avrdude , 6.1 ) ..... Each tool version may come in different build flavours for different OS. Each flavour is listed under the systems array. In the example above avr-gcc comes with builds for: Linux 64-bit ( x86_64-linux-gnu ), Linux 32-bit ( i686-linux-gnu ), Windows ( i686-mingw32 ), Mac ( i386-apple-darwin11 ) The IDE will take care to install the right flavour based on the host value, or fail if a needed flavour is missing. Note that this information is not used to select the toolchain during compilation. If you want this specific version to be used, you should use the notation {runtime.tools.TOOLNAME-VERSION.path} in the platform.txt. The other fields are: url : the download URL of the tool's archive archiveFileName : the name of the file saved to disk after the download (some web servers don't provide the filename through the HTTP request) size : the size of the archive in bytes checksum : the checksum of the archive, used to check if the file has been corrupted. The format is ALGORITHM:CHECKSUM , currently MD5 , SHA-1 , SHA-256 algorithm are supported, we recommend SHA-256 .

Platforms add support for new boards to the Arduino development software. They are installable either via Boards Manager or manual installation to the hardware folder of Arduino's sketchbook folder (AKA \"user directory\"). A platform may consist of as little as a single configuration file. Hardware Folders structure \u00b6 The new hardware folders have a hierarchical structure organized in two levels: the first level is the vendor/maintainer the second level is the supported architecture A vendor/maintainer can have multiple supported architectures. For example, below we have three hardware vendors called \"arduino\", \"yyyyy\" and \"xxxxx\": hardware/arduino/avr/... - Arduino - AVR Boards hardware/arduino/sam/... - Arduino - SAM (32bit ARM) Boards hardware/yyyyy/avr/... - Yyy - AVR hardware/xxxxx/avr/... - Xxx - AVR The vendor \"arduino\" has two supported architectures (AVR and SAM), while \"xxxxx\" and \"yyyyy\" have only AVR. Architecture values are case sensitive (e.g. AVR != avr ). If possible, follow existing architecture name conventions when creating hardware packages. Use the vendor folder name to differentiate your package. The architecture folder name is used to determine library compatibility and to permit referencing resources from another core of the same architecture, so use of a non-standard architecture name can have a harmful effect. Architecture configurations \u00b6 Each architecture must be configured through a set of configuration files: platform.txt contains definitions for the CPU architecture used (compiler, build process parameters, tools used for upload, etc.) boards.txt contains definitions for the boards (board name, parameters for building and uploading sketches, etc.) programmers.txt contains definitions for external programmers (typically used to burn bootloaders or sketches on a blank CPU/board) Configuration files format \u00b6 A configuration file is a list of \"key=value\" properties. The value of a property can be expressed using the value of another property by putting its name inside brackets \"{\" \"}\". For example: compiler.path=/tools/g++_arm_none_eabi/bin/ compiler.c.cmd=arm-none-eabi-gcc [....] recipe.c.o.pattern={compiler.path}{compiler.c.cmd} In this example the property recipe.c.o.pattern will be set to /tools/g++_arm_none_eabi/bin/arm-none-eabi-gcc , which is the composition of the properties compiler.path and compiler.c.cmd . Comments \u00b6 Lines starting with # are treated as comments and will be ignored. # Like in this example # -------------------- # I'm a comment! Automatic property override for specific OS \u00b6 We can specify an OS-specific value for a property. For example the following file: tools.bossac.cmd=bossac tools.bossac.cmd.windows=bossac.exe will set the property tools.bossac.cmd to the value bossac on Linux and macOS and bossac.exe on Windows. Supported suffixes are .linux , .windows and .macosx . Global Predefined properties \u00b6 The following automatically generated properties can be used globally in all configuration files: {runtime.platform.path} : the absolute path of the board platform folder (i.e. the folder containing boards.txt) {runtime.hardware.path} : the absolute path of the hardware folder (i.e. the folder containing the board platform folder) {runtime.ide.path} : the absolute path of the Arduino IDE or Arduino CLI folder {runtime.ide.version} : the version number of the Arduino IDE as a number (this uses two digits per version number component, and removes the points and leading zeroes, so Arduino IDE 1.8.3 becomes 01.08.03 which becomes runtime.ide.version=10803 ). When using Arduino development software other than the Arduino IDE, this is set to a meaningless version number. {ide_version} : Compatibility alias for {runtime.ide.version} {runtime.os} : the running OS (\"linux\", \"windows\", \"macosx\") {software} : set to \"ARDUINO\" {name} : platform vendor name {_id} : board ID of the board being compiled for {build.fqbn} : the FQBN (fully qualified board name) of the board being compiled for. The FQBN follows the format: VENDOR:ARCHITECTURE:BOARD_ID[:MENU_ID=OPTION_ID[,MENU2_ID=OPTION_ID ...]] {build.source.path} : Path to the sketch being compiled. If the sketch is in an unsaved state, it will the path of its temporary folder. {build.library_discovery_phase} : set to 1 during library discovery and to 0 during normal build. A macro defined with this property can be used to disable the inclusion of heavyweight headers during discovery to reduce compilation time. This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.8.14/Arduino Builder 1.6.0/Arduino CLI 0.12.0. Note: with the same intent, -DARDUINO_LIB_DISCOVERY_PHASE was added to recipe.preproc.macros during library discovery in Arduino Builder 1.5.3/Arduino CLI 0.10.0. That flag was replaced by the more flexible {build.library_discovery_phase} property. {compiler.optimization_flags} : see \"Sketch debugging configuration\" for details {extra.time.utc} : Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) according to the machine the build is running on {extra.time.local} : Unix time with local timezone and DST offset {extra.time.zone} : local timezone offset without the DST component {extra.time.dst} : local daylight savings time offset Compatibility note: Versions before Arduino IDE 1.6.0 only used one digit per version number component in {runtime.ide.version} (so 1.5.9 was 159 , not 10509 ). platform.txt \u00b6 The platform.txt file contains information about a platform's specific aspects (compilers command line flags, paths, system libraries, etc.). The following meta-data must be defined: name=Arduino AVR Boards version=1.5.3 The name will be shown as the Arduino IDE's Board menu section title or the Name field of arduino-cli core list 's output for the platform. The version is currently unused, it is reserved for future use (probably together with the Boards Manager to handle dependencies on cores). Build process \u00b6 The platform.txt file is used to configure the build process. This is done through a list of recipes . Each recipe is a command line expression that explains how to call the compiler (or other tools) for every build step and which parameter should be passed. The Arduino development software, before starting the build, determines the list of files to compile. The list is composed of: the user's Sketch source code in the selected board's Core source code in the Libraries used in the sketch A temporary folder is created to store the build artifacts whose path is available through the global property {build.path} . A property {build.project_name} with the name of the project and a property {build.arch} with the name of the architecture is set as well. {build.path} : The path to the temporary folder to store build artifacts {build.project_name} : The project name {build.arch} : The MCU architecture (avr, sam, etc...) There are some other {build.xxx} properties available, that are explained in the boards.txt section of this guide. Recipes to compile source code \u00b6 We said that the Arduino development software determines a list of files to compile. Each file can be source code written in C (.c files), C++ (.cpp files) or Assembly (.S files). Every language is compiled using its respective recipe : recipe.c.o.pattern : for C files recipe.cpp.o.pattern : for CPP files recipe.S.o.pattern : for Assembly files The recipes can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties (for each file compiled): {includes} : the list of include paths in the format \"-I/include/path -I/another/path....\" {source_file} : the path to the source file {object_file} : the path to the output file For example the following is used for AVR: ## Compiler global definitions compiler.path={runtime.ide.path}/tools/avr/bin/ compiler.c.cmd=avr-gcc compiler.c.flags=-c -g -Os -w -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -MMD [......] ## Compile c files recipe.c.o.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.c.cmd}\" {compiler.c.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -DF_CPU={build.f_cpu} -DARDUINO={runtime.ide.version} -DARDUINO_{build.board} -DARDUINO_ARCH_{build.arch} {build.extra_flags} {includes} \"{source_file}\" -o \"{object_file}\" Note that some properties, like {build.mcu} for example, are taken from the boards.txt file which is documented later in this specification. Recipes to build the core.a archive file \u00b6 The core of the selected board is compiled as described in the previous paragraph, but the object files obtained from the compile are also archived into a static library named core.a using the recipe.ar.pattern . The recipe can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {object_file} : the object file to include in the archive {archive_file_path} : fully qualified archive file (ex. \"/path/to/core.a\"). This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.6.6/arduino builder 1.0.0-beta12 as a replacement for {build.path}/{archive_file} . {archive_file} : the name of the resulting archive (ex. \"core.a\") For example, Arduino provides the following for AVR: compiler.ar.cmd=avr-ar compiler.ar.flags=rcs [......] ## Create archives recipe.ar.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.ar.cmd}\" {compiler.ar.flags} \"{archive_file_path}\" \"{object_file}\" Recipes for linking \u00b6 All the artifacts produced by the previous steps (sketch object files, libraries object files and core.a archive) are linked together using the recipe.c.combine.pattern . The recipe can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {object_files} : the list of object files to include in the archive (\"file1.o file2.o ....\") {archive_file_path} : fully qualified archive file (ex. \"/path/to/core.a\"). This property was added in Arduino IDE 1.6.6/arduino builder 1.0.0-beta12 as a replacement for {build.path}/{archive_file} . {archive_file} : the name of the core archive file (ex. \"core.a\") {compiler.libraries.ldflags} : the linking flags for precompiled libraries, which consist of automatically generated -L flags for the library path and -l flags for library files, as well as any custom flags provided via the ldflags field of library.properties. In order to support precompiled libraries, platform.txt must contain a definition of compiler.libraries.ldflags , to which any automatically generated flags will be appended. Support for precompiled libraries was added in Arduino IDE 1.8.6/arduino-builder 1.4.0. For example the following is used for AVR: compiler.c.elf.flags=-Os -Wl,--gc-sections compiler.c.elf.cmd=avr-gcc compiler.libraries.ldflags= [......] ## Combine gc-sections, archives, and objects recipe.c.combine.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.c.elf.cmd}\" {compiler.c.elf.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -o \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" {object_files} {compiler.libraries.ldflags} \"{archive_file_path}\" \"-L{build.path}\" -lm Recipes for extraction of executable files and other binary data \u00b6 An arbitrary number of extra steps can be performed at the end of objects linking. These steps can be used to extract binary data used for upload and they are defined by a set of recipes with the following format: recipe.objcopy.FILE_EXTENSION_1.pattern=[.....] recipe.objcopy.FILE_EXTENSION_2.pattern=[.....] [.....] FILE_EXTENSION_x must be replaced with the extension of the extracted file, for example the AVR platform needs two files a .hex and a .eep , so we made two recipes like: recipe.objcopy.eep.pattern=[.....] recipe.objcopy.hex.pattern=[.....] There are no specific properties set by the Arduino development software here. A full example for the AVR platform can be: ## Create eeprom recipe.objcopy.eep.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.objcopy.cmd}\" {compiler.objcopy.eep.flags} \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.eep\" ## Create hex recipe.objcopy.hex.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.elf2hex.cmd}\" {compiler.elf2hex.flags} \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.elf\" \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex\" Recipes to compute binary sketch size \u00b6 At the end of the build the Arduino development software shows the final binary sketch size to the user. The size is calculated using the recipe recipe.size.pattern . The output of the command executed using the recipe is parsed through the regular expressions set in the properties: recipe.size.regex : Program storage space used. recipe.size.regex.data : Dynamic memory used by global variables. For AVR we have: compiler.size.cmd=avr-size [....] ## Compute size recipe.size.pattern=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.size.cmd}\" -A \"{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex\" recipe.size.regex=^(?:\\.text|\\.data|\\.bootloader)\\s+([0-9]+).* recipe.size.regex.data=^(?:\\.data|\\.bss|\\.noinit)\\s+([0-9]+).* Recipes to export compiled binary \u00b6 When you do a Sketch > Export compiled Binary in the Arduino IDE, the compiled binary is copied from the build folder to the sketch folder. Two binaries are copied; the standard binary, and a binary that has been merged with the bootloader file (identified by the .with_bootloader in the filename). Two recipes affect how Export compiled Binary works: recipe.output.tmp_file : Defines the binary's filename in the build folder. recipe.output.save_file : Defines the filename to use when copying the binary file to the sketch folder. As with other processes, there are pre and post build hooks for Export compiled Binary . The recipe.hooks.savehex.presavehex.NUMBER.pattern and recipe.hooks.savehex.postsavehex.NUMBER.pattern hooks (but not recipe.output.tmp_file and recipe.output.save_file ) can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {sketch_path} - the absolute path of the sketch folder Recipe to run the preprocessor \u00b6 For detecting which libraries to include in the build, and for generating function prototypes, (just) the preprocessor is run. For this, the recipe.preproc.macros recipe exists. This recipe must run the preprocessor on a given source file, writing the preprocessed output to a given output file, and generate (only) preprocessor errors on standard output. This preprocessor run should happen with the same defines and other preprocessor-influencing-options as for normally compiling the source files. The recipes can be built concatenating other automatically generated properties (for each file compiled): {includes} : the list of include paths in the format \"-I/include/path -I/another/path....\" {source_file} : the path to the source file {preprocessed_file_path} : the path to the output file For example the following is used for AVR: preproc.macros.flags=-w -x c++ -E -CC recipe.preproc.macros=\"{compiler.path}{compiler.cpp.cmd}\" {compiler.cpp.flags} {preproc.macros.flags} -mmcu={build.mcu} -DF_CPU={build.f_cpu} -DARDUINO={runtime.ide.version} -DARDUINO_{build.board} -DARDUINO_ARCH_{build.arch} {compiler.cpp.extra_flags} {build.extra_flags} {includes} \"{source_file}\" -o \"{preprocessed_file_path}\" Note that the {preprocessed_file_path} might point to (your operating system's equivalent) of /dev/null . In this case, also passing -MMD to gcc is problematic, as it will try to generate a dependency file called /dev/null.d , which will usually result in a permission error. Since platforms typically include {compiler.cpp.flags} here, which includes -MMD , the -MMD option is automatically filtered out of the recipe.preproc.macros recipe to prevent this error. If recipe.preproc.macros is not defined, it is automatically generated from recipe.cpp.o.pattern . Note that older Arduino IDE versions used the recipe.preproc.includes recipe (which is not documented here) to determine includes. Since Arduino IDE 1.6.7 (arduino-builder 1.2.0) this was changed and recipe.preproc.includes is no longer used. Pre and post build hooks (since Arduino IDE 1.6.5) \u00b6 You can specify pre and post actions around each recipe. These are called \"hooks\". Here is the complete list of available hooks: recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before sketch compilation) recipe.hooks.sketch.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after sketch compilation) recipe.hooks.libraries.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before libraries compilation) recipe.hooks.libraries.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after libraries compilation) recipe.hooks.core.prebuild.NUMBER.pattern (called before core compilation) recipe.hooks.core.postbuild.NUMBER.pattern (called after core compilation) recipe.hooks.linking.prelink.NUMBER.pattern (called before linking) recipe.hooks.linking.postlink.NUMBER.pattern (called after linking) recipe.hooks.objcopy.preobjcopy.NUMBER.pattern (called before objcopy recipes execution) recipe.hooks.objcopy.postobjcopy.NUMBER.pattern (called after objcopy recipes execution) recipe.hooks.savehex.presavehex.NUMBER.pattern (called before savehex recipe execution) recipe.hooks.savehex.postsavehex.NUMBER.pattern (called after savehex recipe execution) Example: you want to execute two commands before sketch compilation and one after linking. You'll add to your platform.txt: recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.1.pattern=echo sketch compilation started at recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.2.pattern=date recipe.hooks.linking.postlink.1.pattern=echo linking is complete Warning: hooks recipes are sorted before execution. If you need to write more than 10 recipes for a single hook, pad the number with a zero, for example: recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.01.pattern=echo 1 recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.02.pattern=echo 2 ... recipe.hooks.sketch.prebuild.11.pattern=echo 11 Global platform.txt \u00b6 Properties defined in a platform.txt created in the hardware subfolder of the Arduino IDE installation folder will be used for all platforms and will override local properties. This feature is currently only available when using the Arduino IDE. platform.local.txt \u00b6 Introduced in Arduino IDE 1.5.7. This file can be used to override properties defined in platform.txt or define new properties without modifying platform.txt (e.g. when platform.txt is tracked by a version control system). It should be placed in the same folder as the platform.txt it supplements. boards.txt \u00b6 This file contains definitions and metadata for the boards supported by the platform. Boards are referenced by their short name, the board ID. The settings for a board are defined through a set of properties with keys having the board ID as prefix. For example, the board ID chosen for the Arduino Uno board is \"uno\". An extract of the Uno board configuration in boards.txt looks like: [......] uno.name=Arduino Uno uno.build.mcu=atmega328p uno.build.f_cpu=16000000L uno.build.board=AVR_UNO uno.build.core=arduino uno.build.variant=standard [......] Note that all the relevant keys start with the board ID uno.xxxxx . The uno.name property contains the human-friendly name of the board. This is shown in the Board menu of the IDEs, the \"Board Name\" field of Arduino CLI's text output, or the \"name\" key of Arduino CLI's JSON output. The uno.build.board property is used to set a compile-time macro ARDUINO_{build.board} to allow use of conditional code between #ifdef s. If not defined, a build.board value is automatically generated and the Arduino development software outputs a warning. In this case the macro defined at compile time will be ARDUINO_AVR_UNO . The other properties will override the corresponding global properties when the user selects the board. These properties will be globally available, in other configuration files too, without the board ID prefix: uno.build.mcu => build.mcu uno.build.f_cpu => build.f_cpu uno.build.board => build.board uno.build.core => build.core uno.build.variant => build.variant This explains the presence of {build.mcu} or {build.board} in the platform.txt recipes: their value is overwritten respectively by {uno.build.mcu} and {uno.build.board} when the Uno board is selected! Moreover the following properties are automatically generated: {build.core.path} : The path to the selected board's core folder (inside the core platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/core/arduino) {build.system.path} : The path to the core platform 's system folder if available (for example hardware/arduino/sam/system) {build.variant.path} : The path to the selected board variant folder (inside the variant platform , for example hardware/arduino/avr/variants/micro) Cores \u00b6 Cores are placed inside the cores subfolder. Many different cores can be provided within a single platform. For example the following could be a valid platform layout: hardware/arduino/avr/cores/ : Cores folder for \"avr\" architecture, package \"arduino\" hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino : the Arduino Core hardware/arduino/avr/cores/rtos : a hypothetical RTOS Core The board's property build.core is used to find the core that must be compiled and linked when the board is selected. For example if a board needs the Arduino core the build.core variable should be set to: uno.build.core=arduino or if the RTOS core is needed, to: uno.build.core=rtos In any case the contents of the selected core folder are compiled and the core folder path is added to the include files search path. ArduinoCore-API \u00b6 Although much of the implementation of a core is architecture-specific, the standardized core API and the hardware independent components should be the same for every Arduino platform. In order to free platform authors from the burden of individually maintaining duplicates of this common code, Arduino has published it in a dedicated repository from which it may easily be shared by all platforms. In addition to significantly reducing the effort required to write and maintain a core, ArduinoCore-API assists core authors in providing the unprecedented level of portability between platforms that is a hallmark of the Arduino project. See the arduino/ArduinoCore-API repository for more information. Core Variants \u00b6 Sometimes a board needs some tweaking on the default core configuration (different pin mapping is a typical example). A core variant folder is an additional folder that is compiled together with the core and allows platform developers to easily add specific configurations. Variants must be placed inside the variants folder in the current architecture. For example, Arduino AVR Boards uses: hardware/arduino/avr/cores : Core folder for \"avr\" architecture, \"arduino\" package hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino : The Arduino core hardware/arduino/avr/variants/ : Variant folder for \"avr\" architecture, \"arduino\" package hardware/arduino/avr/variants/standard : ATmega328 based variants hardware/arduino/avr/variants/leonardo : ATmega32U4 based variants In this example, the Arduino Uno board needs the standard variant so the build.variant property is set to standard : [.....] uno.build.core=arduino uno.build.variant=standard [.....] instead, the Arduino Leonardo board needs the leonardo variant: [.....] leonardo.build.core=arduino leonardo.build.variant=leonardo [.....] In the example above, both Uno and Leonardo share the same core but use different variants. In any case, the contents of the selected variant folder path is added to the include search path and its contents are compiled and linked with the sketch. The parameter build.variant.path is automatically generated. Board VID/PID \u00b6 USB vendor IDs (VID) and product IDs (PID) identify USB devices to the computer. If the board uses a unique VID/PID pair, it may be defined in boards.txt: uno.vid.0=0x2341 uno.pid.0=0x0043 uno.vid.1=0x2341 uno.pid.1=0x0001 The vid and pid properties end with an arbitrary number, which allows multiple VID/PID pairs to be defined for a board. The snippet above is defining the 2341:0043 and 2341:0001 pairs used by Uno boards. The Arduino development software uses the vid and pid properties to automatically identify the boards connected to the computer. This convenience feature isn't available for boards that don't present a unique VID/PID pair. Serial Monitor control signal configuration \u00b6 Arduino boards that use a USB to TTL serial adapter chip for communication with the computer (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega) often utilize the DTR (data terminal ready) or RTS (request to send) serial control signals as a mechanism for the Arduino development software to trigger a reset of the primary microcontroller. The adapter's DTR and RTS pins are set LOW when the control signals are asserted by the computer and this LOW level is converted into a pulse on the microcontroller's reset pin by an \"auto-reset\" circuit on the board. The auto-reset system is necessary to activate the bootloader at the start of an upload. This system is also used to reset the microcontroller when Serial Monitor is started. The reset is convenient because it allows viewing all serial output from the time the program starts. In case the reset caused by opening Serial Monitor is not desirable, the control signal assertion behavior of Serial Monitor is configurable via the serial.disableDTR and serial.disableRTS properties. Setting these properties to true will prevent Serial Monitor from asserting the control signals when that board is selected: [.....] uno.serial.disableDTR=true uno.serial.disableRTS=true [.....] Hiding boards \u00b6 Adding a hide property to a board definition causes it to not be shown in the Arduino IDE's Tools > Board menu. uno.hide= The value of the property is ignored; it's the presence or absence of the property that controls the board's visibility. Tools \u00b6 The Arduino development software uses external command line tools to upload the compiled sketch to the board or to burn bootloaders using external programmers. For example, avrdude is used for AVR based boards and bossac for SAM based boards, but there is no limit, any command line executable can be used. The command line parameters are specified using recipes in the same way used for platform build process. Tools are configured inside the platform.txt file. Every Tool is identified by a short name, the Tool ID. A tool can be used for different purposes: upload a sketch to the target board (using a bootloader preinstalled on the board) program a sketch to the target board using an external programmer erase the target board's flash memory using an external programmer burn a bootloader into the target board using an external programmer debug a sketch Each action has its own recipe and its configuration is done through a set of properties having key starting with tools prefix followed by the tool ID and the action: [....] tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.program.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.erase.pattern=[......] [....] tools.avrdude.bootloader.pattern=[......] [.....] A tool may have some actions not defined (it's not mandatory to define all four actions). Let's look at how the upload action is defined for avrdude: tools.avrdude.path={runtime.tools.avrdude.path} tools.avrdude.cmd.path={path}/bin/avrdude tools.avrdude.config.path={path}/etc/avrdude.conf tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.protocol} -P{serial.port} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" A {runtime.tools.TOOL_NAME.path} and {runtime.tools.TOOL_NAME-TOOL_VERSION.path} property is generated for the tools of Arduino AVR Boards and any other platform installed via Boards Manager. {runtime.tools.TOOL_NAME.path} points to the latest version of the tool available. The tool configuration properties are available globally without the prefix. For example, the tools.avrdude.cmd.path property can be used as {cmd.path} inside the recipe, and the same happens for all the other avrdude configuration variables. Verbose parameter \u00b6 It is possible for the user to enable verbosity from the Preferences panel of the IDEs or Arduino CLI's --verbose flag. This preference is transferred to the command line using the ACTION.verbose property (where ACTION is the action we are considering). When the verbose mode is enabled, the tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verbose property is copied into ACTION.verbose . When the verbose mode is disabled, the tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.quiet property is copied into ACTION.verbose . Confused? Maybe an example will make things clear: tools.avrdude.upload.params.verbose=-v -v -v -v tools.avrdude.upload.params.quiet=-q -q tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" {upload.verbose} -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.protocol} -P{serial.port} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" In this example if the user enables verbose mode, then {upload.params.verbose} is used in {upload.verbose} : tools.avrdude.upload.params.verbose => upload.verbose If the user didn't enable verbose mode, then {upload.params.quiet} is used in {upload.verbose} : tools.avrdude.upload.params.quiet => upload.verbose Sketch upload configuration \u00b6 The Upload action is triggered when the user clicks on the \"Upload\" button on the IDE toolbar or uses arduino-cli upload . Arduino uses the term \"upload\" for the process of transferring a program to the Arduino board. The upload.tool property determines the tool to be used for upload. A specific upload.tool property should be defined for every board in boards.txt: [......] uno.upload.tool=avrdude [......] leonardo.upload.tool=avrdude [......] Other upload parameters can also be defined for the board. For example, in the Arduino AVR Boards boards.txt we have: [.....] uno.name=Arduino Uno uno.upload.tool=avrdude uno.upload.protocol=arduino uno.upload.maximum_size=32256 uno.upload.speed=115200 [.....] leonardo.name=Arduino Leonardo leonardo.upload.tool=avrdude leonardo.upload.protocol=avr109 leonardo.upload.maximum_size=28672 leonardo.upload.speed=57600 leonardo.upload.use_1200bps_touch=true leonardo.upload.wait_for_upload_port=true [.....] Most {upload.XXXX} variables are used later in the avrdude upload recipe in platform.txt: [.....] tools.avrdude.upload.pattern=\"{cmd.path}\" \"-C{config.path}\" {upload.verbose} -p{build.mcu} -c{upload.protocol} -P{serial.port} -b{upload.speed} -D \"-Uflash:w:{build.path}/{build.project_name}.hex:i\" [.....] Upload verification \u00b6 Upload verification can be enabled via the Arduino IDE's File > Preferences > Verify code after upload or arduino-cli upload --verify . This uses a system similar to the verbose parameter . tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify defines the value of the ACTION.verify property when verification is enabled and tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.noverify the value when verification is disabled. The {ACTION.verify} property is only defined for the upload and program actions of upload.tool . Prior to Arduino IDE 1.6.9, tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify/noverify were not supported and {upload.verify} was set to true / false according to the verification preference setting, while {program.verify} was left undefined. For this reason, backwards compatibility with older IDE versions requires the addition of definitions for the upload.verify and program.verify properties to platform.txt: [.....] tools.avrdude.upload.verify= [.....] tools.avrdude.program.verify= [.....] These definitions are overridden with the value defined by tools.TOOL_ID.ACTION.params.verify/noverify when a modern version of Arduino development software is in use. 1200 bps bootloader reset \u00b6 Some Arduino boards use a dedicated USB-to-serial chip, that takes care of restarting the main MCU (starting the bootloader) when the serial port is opened. However, boards that have a native USB connection (such as the Leonardo or Zero) will have to disconnect from USB when rebooting into the bootloader (after which the bootloader reconnects to USB and offers a new serial port for uploading). After the upload is complete, the bootloader disconnects from USB again, starts the sketch, which then reconnects to USB. Because of these reconnections, the standard restart-on-serial open will not work, since that would cause the serial port to disappear and be closed again. Instead, the sketch running on these boards interprets a bitrate of 1200 bps as a signal the bootloader should be started. To let the Arduino development software perform these steps, two board properties can be set to true : use_1200bps_touch causes the selected serial port to be briefly opened at 1200 bps (8N1) before starting the upload. wait_for_upload_port causes the upload procedure to wait for the serial port to (re)appear before and after the upload. This is only used when use_1200bps_touch is also set. When set, after doing the 1200 bps touch, the development software will wait for a new serial port to appear and use that as the port for uploads. Alternatively, if the original port does not disappear within a few seconds, the upload continues with the original port (which can be the case if the board was already put into bootloader manually, or the the disconnect and reconnect was missed). Additionally, after the upload is complete, the IDE again waits for a new port to appear (or the originally selected port to be present). Note that the IDE implementation of this 1200 bps touch has some peculiarities, and the newer arduino-cli implementation also seems different (does not wait for the port after the reset, which is probably only needed in the IDE to prevent opening the wrong port on the serial monitor, and does not have a shorter timeout when the port never disappears). Upload Using Programmer by default \u00b6 If the upload.protocol property is not defined for a board, the Arduino IDE's \"Upload\" process will use the same behavior as \"Upload Using Programmer\" . This is convenient for boards which only support uploading via programmer. Serial port \u00b6 The full path (e.g., /dev/ttyACM0 ) of the port selected via the IDE or arduino-cli upload 's --port option is available as a configuration property {serial.port} . The file component of the port's path (e.g., ttyACM0 ) is available as the configuration property {serial.port.file} . Upload using an external programmer \u00b6 TODO... The platform.txt associated with the selected programmer will be used. Burn Bootloader \u00b6 TODO... The platform.txt associated with the selected board will be used. Sketch debugging configuration \u00b6 Starting from Arduino CLI 0.9.0 / Arduino Pro IDE v0.0.5-alpha.preview, sketch debugging support is available for platforms. The debug action is triggered when the user clicks Debug > Start Debugging in the Arduino Pro IDE or runs the arduino-cli debug command. The debug.tool property specifies the tool ID of the tool to be used for debugging. A debug.tool property may be defined for each board in boards.txt. The compiler optimization level that is appropriate for normal usage will often not provide a good experience while debugging. For this reason, it may be helpful to use different compiler flags when compiling a sketch for use with the debugger. The flags for use when compiling for debugging can be defined via the compiler.optimization_flags.debug property, and those for normal use via the compiler.optimization_flags.release property. The compiler.optimization_flags property will be defined according to one or the other depending on the Arduino Pro IDE's Sketch > Optimize for Debugging setting or arduino-cli compile 's --optimize-for-debug option. The debug recipe is defined via tools.TOOL_NAME.debug.pattern . It can be built concatenating the following automatically generated properties: {interpreter} : the GDB command interpreter to use. It is configurable via arduino-cli debug --interpreter . This property was added in Arduino CLI 0.10.0 / Arduino Pro IDE v0.0.7-alpha.preview. Custom board options \u00b6 It can sometimes be useful to provide user selectable configuration options for a specific board. For example, a board could be provided in two or more variants with different microcontrollers, or may have different crystal speed based on the board model, and so on... When using Arduino CLI, the option can be selected via the FQBN. In the Arduino IDE the options add extra menu items under the \"Tools\" menu. In Arduino Web Editor, the options are displayed in the \"Flavours\" menu. Let's see an example of how a custom option is implemented. The board used in the example is the Arduino Duemilanove. This board was produced in two models, one with an ATmega168 microcontroller and another with an ATmega328P. We are going then to define a custom option, using the \"cpu\" MENU_ID, that allows the user to choose between the two different microcontrollers. We must first define a set of menu.MENU_ID=Text properties. Text is what is displayed on the GUI for every custom menu we are going to create and must be declared at the beginning of the boards.txt file: menu.cpu=Processor [.....] in this case, the menu name is \"Processor\". Now let's add, always in the boards.txt file, the default configuration (common to all processors) for the duemilanove board: menu.cpu=Processor [.....] duemilanove.name=Arduino Duemilanove duemilanove.upload.tool=avrdude duemilanove.upload.protocol=arduino duemilanove.build.f_cpu=16000000L duemilanove.build.board=AVR_DUEMILANOVE duemilanove.build.core=arduino duemilanove.build.variant=standard [.....] Now let's define the possible values of the \"cpu\" option: [.....] duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328=ATmega328P [.....] duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168=ATmega168 [.....] We have defined two values: \"atmega328\" and \"atmega168\". Note that the property keys must follow the format BOARD_ID.menu.MENU_ID.OPTION_ID=Text , where Text is what is displayed under the \"Processor\" menu in the IDE's GUI. Finally, the specific configuration for each option value: [.....] ## Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega328P duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328=ATmega328P duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.upload.maximum_size=30720 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.upload.speed=57600 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega328.build.mcu=atmega328p ## Arduino Duemilanove w/ ATmega168 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168=ATmega168 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.maximum_size=14336 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.speed=19200 duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.build.mcu=atmega168 [.....] Note that when the user selects an option value, all the \"sub properties\" of that value are copied in the global configuration. For example, when the user selects \"ATmega168\" from the \"Processor\" menu, or uses the FQBN arduino:avr:duemilanove:cpu=atmega168 with Arduino CLI, the configuration under atmega168 is made available globally: duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.maximum_size => upload.maximum_size duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.upload.speed => upload.speed duemilanove.menu.cpu.atmega168.build.mcu => build.mcu There is no limit to the number of custom menus that can be defined. Referencing another core, variant or tool \u00b6 The Arduino platform referencing system allows using components of other platforms in cases where it would otherwise be necessary to duplicate those components. This feature allows us to reduce the minimum set of files needed to define a new \"hardware\" to just the boards.txt file. Core reference \u00b6 Inside the boards.txt we can define a board that uses a core provided by another vendor/maintainer using the syntax VENDOR_ID:CORE_ID . For example, if we want to define a board that uses the \"arduino\" core from the \"arduino\" vendor we should write: [....] myboard.name=My Wonderful Arduino Compatible board myboard.build.core=arduino:arduino [....] Note that we don't need to specify any architecture since the same architecture of \"myboard\" is used, so we just say \"arduino:arduino\" instead of \"arduino:avr:arduino\". The platform.txt settings are inherited from the referenced core platform, thus there is no need to provide a platform.txt unless there are some specific properties that need to be overridden. The bundled libraries from the referenced platform are used, thus there is no need for the referencing platform to bundle those libraries. If libraries are provided, the list of available libraries is the sum of the two libraries, where the referencing platform has priority over the referenced platform. Variant reference \u00b6 In the same way we can use a variant defined on another platform using the syntax VENDOR_ID:VARIANT_ID : [....] myboard.build.variant=arduino:standard [....] Note that referencing a variant in another platform does not inherit any properties from that platform's platform.txt (like referencing a core does). Tool references \u00b6 Tool recipes defined in the platform.txt of other platforms can also be referenced using the syntax VENDOR_ID:TOOL_ID : [....] myboard.upload.tool=arduino:avrdude myboard.bootloader.tool=arduino:avrdude [....] Platform Terminology \u00b6 Because boards can reference cores, variants and tools in different platforms, this means that a single build or upload can use data from up to four different platforms. To keep this clear, the following terminology is used: The \"board platform\" is the platform that defines the currently selected board (e.g. the platform that contains the board.txt the board is defined in. The \"core platform\" is the the platform that contains the core to be used. The \"variant platform\" is the platform that contains the variant to be used. The \"tool platform\" is the platform that contains the tool used for the current operation. In the most common case: a board platform without any references, all of these will refer to the same platform. Note that the above terminology is not in widespread use, but was invented for clarity within this document. In the actual Arduino CLI code, the \"board platform\" is called targetPlatform , the \"core platform\" is called actualPlatform , the others are pretty much nameless. boards.local.txt \u00b6 Introduced in Arduino IDE 1.6.6. This file can be used to override properties defined in boards.txt or define new properties without modifying boards.txt. Platform bundled libraries \u00b6 Arduino libraries placed in the platform's libraries subfolder are accessible when a board of the platform, or of a platform that references the platform's core, is selected. When any other board is selected, the platform bundled libraries are inaccessible. These are often architecture-specific libraries (e.g., SPI, Wire) which must be implemented differently for each architecture. Platform bundled libraries may be used to provide specialized versions of libraries which use the dependency resolution system to override built-in libraries. For more information, see the Arduino library specification . keywords.txt \u00b6 As of Arduino IDE 1.6.6, per-platform keywords can be defined by adding a keywords.txt file to the platform's architecture folder. These keywords are only highlighted in the Arduino IDE when one of the boards of that platform are selected. This file follows the same format as the keywords.txt used in libraries.","title":"Platform specification"},{"location":"platform-specification/#hardware-folders-structure","text":"The new hardware folders have a hierarchical structure organized in two levels: the first level is the vendor/maintainer the second level is the supported architecture A vendor/maintainer can have multiple supported architectures.

Because of these reconnections, the standard restart-on-serial open will not work, since that would cause the serial port to disappear and be closed again. Instead, the sketch running on these boards interprets a bitrate of 1200 bps as a signal the bootloader should be started. To let the Arduino development software perform these steps, two board properties can be set to true : use_1200bps_touch causes the selected serial port to be briefly opened at 1200 bps (8N1) before starting the upload. wait_for_upload_port causes the upload procedure to wait for the serial port to (re)appear before and after the upload. This is only used when use_1200bps_touch is also set. When set, after doing the 1200 bps touch, the development software will wait for a new serial port to appear and use that as the port for uploads. Alternatively, if the original port does not disappear within a few seconds, the upload continues with the original port (which can be the case if the board was already put into bootloader manually, or the the disconnect and reconnect was missed). Additionally, after the upload is complete, the IDE again waits for a new port to appear (or the originally selected port to be present). Note that the IDE implementation of this 1200 bps touch has some peculiarities, and the newer arduino-cli implementation also seems different (does not wait for the port after the reset, which is probably only needed in the IDE to prevent opening the wrong port on the serial monitor, and does not have a shorter timeout when the port never disappears).","title":"1200 bps bootloader reset"},{"location":"platform-specification/#upload-using-programmer-by-default","text":"If the upload.protocol property is not defined for a board, the Arduino IDE's \"Upload\" process will use the same behavior as \"Upload Using Programmer\" .

More useful information can be found in the Arduino platform specification . Note that the following refers specifically to the build process for AVR targets. Other architectures will have a similar build process. Overview \u00b6 A number of things have to happen for your Arduino code to get onto the Arduino board. First, the Arduino development software performs some minor pre-processing to turn your sketch into a C++ program. Next, dependencies of the sketch are located. It then gets passed to a compiler (avr-gcc), which turns the human readable code into machine readable instructions (or object files). Then your code gets combined with (linked against) the standard Arduino libraries that provide basic functions like digitalWrite() or Serial.print() . The result is a single Intel hex file, which contains the specific bytes that need to be written to the program memory of the chip on the Arduino board. This file is then uploaded to the board: transmitted over the USB or serial connection via the bootloader already on the chip or with external programming hardware. Pre-Processing \u00b6 The Arduino development software performs a few transformations to your sketch before passing it to the avr-gcc compiler: All .ino and .pde files in the sketch folder (shown in the Arduino IDE as tabs with no extension) are concatenated together, starting with the file that matches the folder name followed by the others in alphabetical order. The .cpp filename extension is then added to the resulting file. If not already present, #include <Arduino.h> is added to the sketch. This header file (found in the core folder for the currently selected board) includes all the definitions needed for the standard Arduino core. Prototypes are generated for all function definitions in .ino/.pde files that don't already have prototypes. In some rare cases, prototype generation may fail for some functions. To work around this, you can provide your own prototypes for these functions. #line directives are added to make warning or error messages reflect the original sketch layout. No pre-processing is done to files in a sketch with any extension other than .ino or .pde. Additionally, .h files in the sketch are not automatically #included from the main sketch file. Further, if you want to call functions defined in a .c file from a .cpp file (like one generated from your sketch), you'll need to wrap its declarations in an extern \"C\" {} block that is defined only inside of C++ files. Dependency Resolution \u00b6 The sketch is scanned recursively for dependencies. There are predefined include search paths: Core library folder (as defined by {build.core} ) Variant folder (as defined by {build.variant} ) Standard system directories (e.g., {runtime.tools.avr-gcc.path}/avr/include ) Include search paths added to resolve prior dependencies If the dependency is not present in any of those locations, the installed libraries are then searched (see the Location Priority table below for library locations). For information on the allowed library sub-folder structures see the Arduino library specification . -I options are generated for the path to each library dependency and appended to the includes property , to be used in compilation recipes in platform.txt. If multiple libraries contain a file that matches the #include directive, the priority is determined by applying the following rules, one by one in this order, until a rule determines a winner: A library that is architecture compatible wins against a library that is not architecture compatible (see Architecture Matching ) A library that has better \"folder name priority\" wins (see Folder Name Priority ) A library that is architecture optimized wins against a library that is not architecture optimized (see Architecture Matching ) A library that has a better \"location priority\" wins (see Location Priority ) A library that has a folder name with a better score using the \"closest-match\" algorithm wins A library that has a folder name that comes first in alphanumeric order wins Architecture Matching \u00b6 A library is considered compatible with architecture X if the architectures field in library.properties : explicitly contains the architecture X contains the catch-all * is not specified at all. A library is considered optimized for architecture X only if the architectures field in library.properties explicitly contains the architecture X . This means that a library that is optimized for architecture X is also compatible with it. Examples: architectures field in library.properties Compatible with avr Optimized for avr not specified YES NO architectures=* YES NO architectures=avr YES YES architectures=*,avr YES YES architectures=*,esp8266 YES NO architectures=avr,esp8266 YES YES architectures=samd NO NO Folder Name Priority \u00b6 The \"folder name priority\" is determined as follows (in order of highest to lowest priority): Rule Example for Servo.h The folder name matches the include 100% Servo The folder name matches the include 100%, except with a -master suffix Servo-master The folder name has a matching prefix ServoWhatever The folder name has a matching suffix AwesomeServo The folder name contains the include AnAwesomeServoForWhatever Location Priority \u00b6 The \"location priority\" is determined as follows (in order of highest to lowest priority): The library is under a custom libraries path specified via the --libraries option of arduino-cli compile (in decreasing order of priority when multiple custom paths are defined) The library is under the libraries subfolder of the IDE's sketchbook or Arduino CLI's user directory The library is bundled with the board platform/core ( {runtime.platform.path}/libraries ) The library is bundled with the referenced board platform/core The library is bundled with the Arduino IDE ( {runtime.ide.path}/libraries ) This location is only used by Arduino CLI when it's located in the Arduino IDE installation folder Compilation \u00b6 Sketches are compiled by avr-gcc and avr-g++ according to the variables in the boards.txt file of the selected board's platform . The sketch is built in a temporary directory in the system-wide temporary directory (e.g. /tmp on Linux). Files taken as source files for the build process are .S, .c and .cpp files (including the .cpp file generated from the sketch's .ino and .pde files during the sketch pre-processing step). Source files of the target are compiled and output with .o extensions to this build directory, as are the main sketch files and any other source files in the sketch and any source files in any libraries which are #include d in the sketch. Before compiling a source file, an attempt is made to reuse the previously compiled .o file, which speeds up the build process. A special .d (dependency) file provides a list of all other files included by the source. The compile step is skipped if the .o and .d files exist and have timestamps newer than the source and all the dependent files. If the source or any dependent file has been modified, or any error occurs verifying the files, the compiler is run normally, writing a new .o & .d file. After a new board is selected from the IDE's Board menu, all source files are rebuilt on the next compile. These .o files are then linked together into a static library and the main sketch file is linked against this library. Only the parts of the library needed for your sketch are included in the final .hex file, reducing the size of most sketches. The .hex file is the final output of the compilation which is then uploaded to the board. If verbose output during compilation is enabled, the complete command line of each external command executed as part of the build process will be printed in the console. Uploading \u00b6 Sketches are uploaded by avrdude. The upload process is also controlled by variables in the boards and main preferences files.

The programs that run on Arduino boards are called \"sketches\". This term was inherited from Processing , upon which the Arduino IDE and the core API were based. Sketch folders and files \u00b6 Sketch root folder \u00b6 Because many Arduino sketches only contain a single .ino file, it's easy to think of that file as the sketch. However, it is the folder that is the sketch. The reason is that sketches may consist of multiple code files and the folder is what groups those files into a single program. The sketch root folder name must start with a basic letter ( A - Z or a - z ) or number ( 0 - 9 ), followed by basic letters, numbers, spaces ( ), underscores ( _ ), dots ( . ) and dashes ( - ). The maximum length is 63 characters. Support for sketch folder names starting with a number was added in Arduino IDE 1.8.4. Primary sketch file \u00b6 Every sketch must contain a .ino or .pde file with a file name matching the sketch root folder name. Additional code files \u00b6 Sketches may consist of multiple code files. The following extensions are supported: .ino - Arduino language files. .pde - Alternate extension for Arduino language files. This file extension is also used by Processing sketches. .ino is recommended to avoid confusion. .cpp - C++ files. .c - C Files. .S - Assembly language files. .h - Header files. For information about how each of these files and other parts of the sketch are used during compilation, see the Sketch build process documentation . src subfolder \u00b6 The contents of the src subfolder are compiled recursively. Unlike the code files in the sketch root folder, these files are not shown as tabs in the IDEs. This is useful for files you don't want to expose to the sketch user via the IDE's interface. It can be used to bundle libraries with the sketch in order to make it a self-contained project. Arduino language files under the src folder are not supported. In Arduino IDE 1.6.5-r5 and older, no recursive compilation was done. In Arduino IDE 1.6.6 - 1.6.9, recursive compilation was done of all subfolders of the sketch folder. In Arduino IDE 1.6.10 and newer, recursive compilation is limited to the src subfolder of the sketch folder. data subfolder \u00b6 The data folder is used to add additional files to the sketch, which will not be compiled. Files added to the sketch via the Arduino IDE's Sketch > Add File... are placed in the data folder. The Arduino IDE's File > Save As... only copies the code files in the sketch root folder and the full contents of the data folder, so any non-code files outside the data folder are stripped. Metadata \u00b6 Arduino CLI and Arduino Web Editor use a file named sketch.json, located in the sketch root folder, to store sketch metadata. The cpu key contains the board configuration information. This can be set via arduino-cli board attach or by selecting a board in the Arduino Web Editor while the sketch is open. With this configuration set, it is not necessary to specify the --fqbn or --port flags to the arduino-cli compile or arduino-cli upload commands when compiling or uploading the sketch. The included_libs key defines the library versions the Arduino Web Editor uses when the sketch is compiled. This is Arduino Web Editor specific because all versions of all the Library Manager libraries are pre-installed in Arduino Web Editor, while only one version of each library may be installed when using the other Arduino development software. Secrets \u00b6 Arduino Web Editor has a \"Secret tab\" feature that makes it easy to share sketches without accidentally exposing sensitive data (e.g., passwords or tokens). The Arduino Web Editor automatically generates macros for any identifier in the sketch which starts with SECRET_ and contains all uppercase characters. When you download a sketch from Arduino Web Editor that contains a Secret tab, the empty #define directives for the secrets are in a file named arduino_secrets.h, with an #include directive to that file at the top of the primary sketch file. This is hidden when viewing the sketch in Arduino Web Editor. Documentation \u00b6 Image and text files in common formats which are present in the sketch root folder are displayed in tabs in the Arduino Web Editor. Sketch file structure example \u00b6 Foo |_ arduino_secrets.h |_ Abc.ino |_ Def.cpp |_ Def.h |_ Foo.ino |_ Ghi.c |_ Ghi.h |_ Jkl.h |_ Jkl.S |_ sketch.json |_ data | |_ Schematic.pdf |_ src |_ SomeLib |_ library.properties |_ src |_ SomeLib.h |_ SomeLib.cpp Sketchbook \u00b6 The Arduino IDE provides a \"sketchbook\" folder (analogous to Arduino CLI's \"user directory\"). In addition to being the place where user libraries and manually installed platforms are installed, the sketchbook is a convenient place to store sketches. Sketches in the sketchbook folder appear under the Arduino IDE's File > Sketchbook menu. However, there is no requirement to store sketches in the sketchbook folder. Library/Boards Manager links \u00b6 A URI in a comment in the form http://librarymanager#SEARCH_TERM will open a search for SEARCH_TERM in Library Manager when clicked in the Arduino IDE. A URI in a comment in the form http://boardsmanager#SEARCH_TERM will open a search for SEARCH_TERM in Boards Manager when clicked in the Arduino IDE. This can be used to offer the user an easy way to install dependencies of the sketch. This feature is only available when using the Arduino IDE, so be sure to provide supplementary documentation to help the users of other development software install the sketch dependencies.
