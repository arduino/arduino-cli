Arduino CLI is an all-in-one solution that provides Boards/Library Managers, sketch builder, board detection, uploader,
and many other tools needed to use any Arduino compatible board and platform from command line or machine interfaces.

In addition to being a standalone tool, Arduino CLI is the heart of all official Arduino development software (Arduino
IDE, Arduino Web Editor). Parts of this documentation apply to those tools as well.

## Installation

You have several options to install the latest version of the Arduino CLI on your system, see the [installation] page.
