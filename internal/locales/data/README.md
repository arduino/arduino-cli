# Localization data

This folder contains the [localization](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) data for **Arduino CLI**.

‚ùó These files are automatically generated and so can not be edited directly. If you wish to modify the contents, do it
at the source:

- **en.po** - edit the string in the source code file indicated by the comment above it <br /> e.g., a comment
  `#: internal/cli/lib/check_deps.go:102` indicates the source string is at line 102 of the file
  [`internal/cli/lib/check_deps.go`](../../../internal/cli/lib/check_deps.go)
- **All other files** - the localization is done on **Transifex**: <br />
