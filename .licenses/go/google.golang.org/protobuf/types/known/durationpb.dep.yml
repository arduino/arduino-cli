    patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
    transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this

    order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any
    entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
    that this implementation of Go or any code incorporated within this
    implementation of Go constitutes direct or contributory patent
    infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent
    rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of Go
    shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
