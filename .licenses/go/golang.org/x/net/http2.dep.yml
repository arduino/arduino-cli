      "This implementation" means the copyrightable works distributed by

      Google as part of the Go project.


      Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,

      no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)

      patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,

      transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this

      implementation of Go, where such license applies only to those patent

      claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired in

      the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by this

      implementation of Go.  This grant does not include claims that would be

      infringed only as a consequence of further modification of this

      implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or

      order or agree to the institution of patent litigation against any

      entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging

      that this implementation of Go or any code incorporated within this

      implementation of Go constitutes direct or contributory patent

      infringement, or inducement of patent infringement, then any patent

      rights granted to you under this License for this implementation of Go

      shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
