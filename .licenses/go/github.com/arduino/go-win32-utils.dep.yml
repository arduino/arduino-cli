    2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n59 Temple
    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and
    distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n
    \                           Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed
    to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
    Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to
    make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License
    applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program
    whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software
    is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply
    it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring
    to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
    that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis
    service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want
    it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs;
    and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need
    to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you
    to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
    for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For
    example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a
    fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make
    sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them
    these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps:
    (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal
    permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each
    author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands
    that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified
    by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they
    have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not
    reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program
    is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that
    redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in
    effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
    that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n
    \ The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification
    follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any
    program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder
    saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.
    \ The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based
    on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright
    law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither
    verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter,
    translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each
    licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution
    and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.
    \ The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis
    covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent
    of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on
    what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of
    the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously
    and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer
    of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the
    absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy
    of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical
    act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection
    in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program
    or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute
    such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that
    you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files
    to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date
    of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n
    \   part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties
    under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads
    commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running
    for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n
    \   announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that
    there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that
    users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the
    user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself
    is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work
    based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese
    requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections
    of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered
    independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms,
    do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
    when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non
    the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License,
    whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to
    each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent
    of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely
    by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution
    of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere
    aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with
    a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium
    does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may
    copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object
    code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that
    you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
    Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years,
    to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding
    source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany
    it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding
    source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution
    and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with
    such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for
    a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For
    an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules
    it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as
    a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that
    is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components
    (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable
    runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution
    of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated
    place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same
    place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are
    not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may
    not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided
    under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
    the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
    License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis
    License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain
    in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since
    you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
    or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited
    by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing
    the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance
    of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing
    or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute
    the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives
    a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
    subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions
    on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence
    of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason
    (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court
    order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
    they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute
    so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other
    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program
    at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution
    of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
    you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain
    entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is
    held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance
    of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to
    apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce
    you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity
    of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity
    of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license
    practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of
    software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application
    of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto
    distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that
    choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
    to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution
    and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents
    or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program
    under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus
    excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written
    in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish
    revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.
    \ Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may
    differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given
    a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of
    this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option
    of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later
    version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify
    a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the
    Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different,
    write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
    by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake
    exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving
    the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the
    sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n
    \ 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR
    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE
    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM
    \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
    A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
    PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST
    OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS
    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER,
    OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED
    ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
    (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
    OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE
    WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED
    OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n\n.....................................................................\n\n\t\t
    \ GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t\t       Version 2.1, February 1999\n\n
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n 51 Franklin Street,
    Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
    verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This
    is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts\n as the successor
    of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n\t\t\t
    \   Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom
    to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended
    to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the
    software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public
    License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of
    the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan
    use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license
    or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular
    case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we
    are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are
    designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free
    software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code
    or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces
    of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese
    things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors
    to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions
    translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the
    library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the
    library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
    that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
    source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete
    object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library
    after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them
    these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step
    method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which
    gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n
    \ To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no
    warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else
    and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original
    version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems
    that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant
    threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company
    cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive
    license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained
    for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use
    specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is
    covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral
    Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different
    from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries
    in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When
    a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library,
    the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative
    of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits
    such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The
    Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code
    with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License
    because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic
    License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage
    over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use
    the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser
    license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example,
    on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible
    use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve
    this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent
    case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.
    \ In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware
    only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission
    to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of
    people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use
    the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole
    GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n
    \ Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers'
    freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library
    has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version
    of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution
    and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work
    based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains
    code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library
    in order to run.\n\f\n\t\t  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies
    to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the
    copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under
    the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach
    licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software
    functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
    programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n
    \ The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has
    been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either
    the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work
    containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
    and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation
    is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\"
    for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.
    \ For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules
    it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities
    other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License;
    they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is
    not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents
    constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library
    in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library
    does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n  \n  1. You may copy
    and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive
    it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish
    on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
    intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty;
    and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge
    a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option
    offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your
    copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based
    on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the
    terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n
    \   a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must
    cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed
    the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the
    work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function
    or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the
    facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked,
    then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application
    does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and
    performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example,
    a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely
    well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires
    that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n
    \   be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function
    must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified
    work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from
    the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works
    in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections
    when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution
    of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other
    licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless
    of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
    or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is
    to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective
    works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not
    based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on
    a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe
    scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary
    GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.
    \ To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat
    they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of
    to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General
    Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you
    wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change
    is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU
    General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works
    made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of
    the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may
    copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section
    2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of
    object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then
    offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies
    the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are
    not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program
    that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to
    work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work
    that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work
    of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However,
    linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable
    that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library),
    rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered
    by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n
    \ When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat
    is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work
    of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially
    significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is
    itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined
    by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure
    layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines
    or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless
    of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object
    code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise,
    if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code
    for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work
    also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library
    itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine
    or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork
    containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your
    choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's
    own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must
    give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in
    it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply
    a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices,
    you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as
    a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do
    one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n
    \   machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes
    were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above);
    and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete
    machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source
    code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce
    a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n
    \   that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library
    will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified
    definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with
    the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy
    of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than
    copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly
    with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long
    as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the
    work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for
    at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified
    in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing
    this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access
    to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n
    \   specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has
    already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent
    this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that
    uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing
    the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be
    distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either
    source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on)
    of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself
    accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts
    the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany
    the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and
    the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may
    place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in
    a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License,
    and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution
    of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted,
    and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library
    with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other
    library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections
    above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n
    \   that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where
    to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not
    copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly
    provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
    link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate
    your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor
    rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so
    long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to
    accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants
    you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These
    actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,
    by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary),
    you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and
    conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based
    on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary),
    the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to
    copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and
    conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise
    of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance
    by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court
    judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited
    to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement
    or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse
    you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy
    simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations,
    then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example,
    if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library
    by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe
    only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely
    from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid
    or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section
    is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
    circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
    any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch
    claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the
    free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.
    \ Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software
    distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem;
    it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute
    software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis
    section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence
    of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library
    is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
    the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan
    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that
    distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such
    case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this
    License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions
    of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will
    be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address
    new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.
    \ If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to
    it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions
    either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software
    Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may
    choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14.
    If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose
    distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask
    for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
    write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
    \ Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof
    all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of
    software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED
    FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
    BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
    AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND,
    EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES
    OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
    TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY
    PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n
    \ 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL
    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
    LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
    SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
    TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED
    INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY
    TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES."
