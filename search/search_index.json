This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository. To propose improvements or fix a bug, feel free to submit a PR. Legal requirements \u00b6 Before we can accept your contributions you have to sign the Contributor License Agreement Prerequisites \u00b6 To build the Arduino CLI from sources you need the following tools to be available in your local enviroment: Go version 1.12 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line If you want to run integration tests you will also need: A serial port with an Arduino device attached A working Python environment, version 3.5 or later If you're working on the gRPC interface you will also have to: download the protoc compiler run go get -U github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go Building the source code \u00b6 From the project folder root, just run: task build The project uses Go modules so dependencies will be downloaded automatically; at the end of the build, you should find an arduino-cli executable in the same folder. Running the tests \u00b6 There are several checks and test suites in place to ensure the code works as expected but it's also written in a way that's consistent across the whole codebase. To avoid pushing changes that will cause the CI system to fail, you can run most of the tests locally. To ensure code style is consistent, run: task check To run unit tests: task test-unit To run integration tests (these will take some time and require special setup, see following paragraph): task test-integration Running only some tests \u00b6 By default, all tests from all go packages are run. To run only unit tests from one or more specific packages, you can set the TARGETS environment variable, e.g.: TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task test-unit Alternatively, to run only some specific test(s), you can specify a regex to match against the test function name: TEST_REGEX='^TestTryBuild.*' task test-unit Both can be combined as well, typically to run only a specific test: TEST_REGEX='^TestFindBoardWithFQBN$' TARGETS=./arduino/cores/packagemanager task test-unit Integration tests \u00b6 Being a command line interface, Arduino CLI is heavily interactive and it has to stay consistent in accepting the user input and providing the expected output and proper exit codes. On top of this, many Arduino CLI features involve communicating with external devices, most likely through a serial port, so unit tests can only put our confidence that the code is working so far. For these reasons, in addition to regular unit tests the project has a suite of integration tests that actually run Arduino CLI in a different process and assess the options are correctly understood and the output is what we expect. To run the full suite of integration tests you need an Arduino device attached to a serial port and a working Python environment. Chances are that you already have Python installed in your system, if this is not the case you can download the official distribution or use the package manager provided by your Operating System. Some dependencies need to be installed before running the tests and to avoid polluting your global Python enviroment with dependencies that might be only used by the Arduino CLI, you can use a virtual environment . There are many ways to manage virtual environments, for example you can use a productivity tool called hatch . First you need to install it (you might need to sudo the following command): pip3 install --user hatch Then you can create a virtual environment to be used while working on Arduino CLI: hatch env arduino-cli At this point the virtual environment was created and you need to make it active every time you open a new terminal session with the following command: hatch shell arduino-cli From now on, every package installed by Python will be confined to the arduino-cli virtual environment, so you can proceed installing the dependencies required with: pip install -r test/requirements.txt If the last step was successful, you should be able to run the tests with: task test-integration Working on docs \u00b6 Documentation consists of several Markdown files stored under the docs folder at the root of the repo. Some of those files are automatically generated in the CI pipeline that builds the documentation website so you won't find them in the git repository and you need to generate them locally. If you're working on docs and your changes are not trivial, you might want to preview the documentation website locally, before opening a Pull Request. To run the docs toolchain locally you need to have: Go version 1.12 or later Taskfile to help you run the most common tasks from the command line A working Python environment, version 3.5 or later Before running the toolchain, perform the following operations: go get -u github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc When working on docs, you can launch a command that will take care of generating the docs, build the static website and start a local server you can access with your browser to see a preview of your changes - to launch this command do: task docs:serve If you dont' see any error, hit http://127.0.0.1:8000 with your browser. Pull Requests \u00b6 In order to ease code reviews and have your contributions merged faster, here is a list of items you can check before submitting a PR: Create small PRs that are narrowly focused on addressing a single concern. PR titles indirectly become part of the CHANGELOG so it's crucial to provide a good record of what change is being made in the title; why it was made will go in the PR description, along with a link to a GitHub issue if it exists. Write tests for the code you wrote. Open your PR against the master branch. Maintain clean commit history and use meaningful commit messages . PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and require a lot of work to be merged. Your PR must pass all CI tests before we will merge it. If you're seeing an error and don't think it's your fault, it may not be! The reviewer will help you if there are test failures that seem not related to the change you are making. Additional settings \u00b6 If you need to push a commit that's only shipping documentation changes or example files, thus a complete no-op for the test suite, please start the commit message with the string [skip ci] to skip the build and give that slot to someone else who does need it. If your PR doesn't need to be included in the changelog, please start the PR title with the string [skip changelog]","title":"How to contribute"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#how-to-contribute","text":"First of all, thanks for contributing!

Before you start \u00b6 arduino-cli is a container of commands and each command has its own dedicated help text that can be shown with the help command like this: $ arduino-cli help core Arduino Core operations. Usage: arduino-cli core [command] Examples: ./arduino-cli core update-index Available Commands: download Downloads one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. install Installs one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies. list Shows the list of installed platforms. search Search for a core in the package index. uninstall Uninstalls one or more cores and corresponding tool dependencies if no more used. update-index Updates the index of cores. upgrade Upgrades one or all installed platforms to the latest version.

(default \"text\") --log-file string Path to the file where logs will be written. --log-format string The output format for the logs, can be [text|json]. --log-level string Messages with this level and above will be logged. -v, --verbose Print the logs on the standard output. Use \"arduino-cli core [command] --help\" for more information about a command. Create a configuration file \u00b6 Arduino CLI doesn't strictly require a configuration file to work because the command line interface provides any possible functionality. However, having one can spare you a lot of typing when issuing a command, so let's create it right ahead with: $ arduino-cli config init Config file written: /home/luca/.arduino15/arduino-cli.yaml If you inspect arduino-cli.yaml contents, you'll find out the available options with their respective default values. Create a new sketch \u00b6 To create a new sketch named MyFirstSketch in the current directory, run the following command: $ arduino-cli sketch new MyFirstSketch Sketch created in: /home/luca/MyFirstSketch A sketch is a folder containing assets like source files and libraries; the new command creates for you a .ino file called MyFirstSketch.ino containing Arduino boilerplate code: $ cat $HOME /MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino void setup () { } void loop () { } At this point you can use your favourite file editor or IDE to open the file $HOME/MyFirstSketch/MyFirstSketch.ino and change the code like this: void setup () { pinMode ( LED_BUILTIN , OUTPUT ); } void loop () { digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , HIGH ); delay ( 1000 ); digitalWrite ( LED_BUILTIN , LOW ); delay ( 1000 ); } Connect the board to your PC \u00b6 The first thing to do upon a fresh install is to update the local cache of available platforms and libraries by running: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded After connecting the board to your PCs by using the USB cable, you should be able to check whether it's been recognized by running: $ arduino-cli board list Port Type Board Name FQBN Core /dev/ttyACM1 Serial Port ( USB ) Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 arduino:samd In this example, the MKR1000 board was recognized and from the output of the command you see the platform core called arduino:samd is the one that needs to be installed to make it work. If you see an Unknown board listed, uploading should still work as long as you identify the platform core and use the correct FQBN string. When a board is not detected for whatever reason, you can list all the supported boards and their FQBN strings by running the following: $ arduino-cli board listall mkr Board Name FQBN Arduino MKR FOX 1200 arduino:samd:mkrfox1200 Arduino MKR GSM 1400 arduino:samd:mkrgsm1400 Arduino MKR WAN 1300 arduino:samd:mkrwan1300 Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 arduino:samd:mkrwifi1010 Arduino MKRZERO arduino:samd:mkrzero Arduino/Genuino MKR1000 arduino:samd:mkr1000 Install the core for your board \u00b6 To install the arduino:samd platform core, run the following: $ arduino-cli core install arduino:samd Downloading tools... arduino:arm-none-eabi-gcc@4.8.3-2014q1 downloaded arduino:bossac@1.7.0 downloaded arduino:openocd@0.9.0-arduino6-static downloaded arduino:CMSIS@4.5.0 downloaded arduino:CMSIS-Atmel@1.1.0 downloaded arduino:arduinoOTA@1.2.0 downloaded Downloading cores... arduino:samd@1.6.19 downloaded Installing tools...

Now we are ready to compile and upload the sketch. Adding 3 rd party cores \u00b6 If your board requires 3 rd party core packages to work, you can list the URLs to additional package indexes in the Arduino CLI configuration file. For example, to add the ESP8266 core, edit the configuration file and change the board_manager settings as follows: board_manager : additional_urls : - https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json From now on, commands supporting custom cores will automatically use the additional URL from the configuration file: $ arduino-cli core update-index Updating index: package_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded Updating index: package_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Alternatively, you can pass a link to the the additional package index file with the --additional-urls option, that has to be specified every time and for every command that operates on a 3 rd party platform core, for example: $ arduino-cli core update-index --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json Updating index: package_esp8266com_index.json downloaded $ arduino-cli core search esp8266 --additional-urls https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json ID Version Name esp8266:esp8266 2 .5.2 esp8266 Compile and upload the sketch \u00b6 To compile the sketch you run the compile command passing the proper FQBN string: $ arduino-cli compile --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch Sketch uses 9600 bytes ( 3 % ) of program storage space. Maximum is 262144 bytes. To upload the sketch to your board, run the following command, this time also providing the serial port where the board is connected: $ arduino-cli upload -p /dev/ttyACM0 --fqbn arduino:samd:mkr1000 MyFirstSketch No new serial port detected.

Add libraries \u00b6 If you need to add more functionalities to your sketch, chances are some of the libraries available in the Arduino ecosystem already provide what you need. For example, if you need a debouncing strategy to better handle button inputs, you can try searching for the debouncer keyword: $ arduino-cli lib search debouncer Name: \"Debouncer\" Author: hideakitai Maintainer: hideakitai Sentence: Debounce library for Arduino Paragraph: Debounce library for Arduino Website: https://github.com/hideakitai Category: Timing Architecture: * Types: Contributed Versions: [ 0 .1.0 ] Name: \"FTDebouncer\" Author: Ubi de Feo Maintainer: Ubi de Feo, Sebastian Hunkeler Sentence: An efficient, low footprint, fast pin debouncing library for Arduino Paragraph: This pin state supervisor manages debouncing of buttons and handles transitions between LOW and HIGH state, calling a function and notifying your code of which pin has been activated or deactivated.

The client_example folder contains a sample client code that shows how to interact with the gRPC server. Available services and messages are detailed in the gRPC reference pages. To provide observability for the gRPC server activities besides logs, the daemon mode activates and exposes by default a Prometheus endpoint ( http://localhost:9090/metrics ) that can be fetched for telemetry data like: # TYPE daemon_compile counter daemon_compile{buildProperties=\"\",exportFile=\"\",fqbn=\"arduino:samd:mkr1000\",installationID=\"ed6f1f22-1fbe-4b1f-84be-84d035b6369c\",jobs=\"0\",libraries=\"\",preprocess=\"false\",quiet=\"false\",showProperties=\"false\",sketchPath=\"5ff767c6fa5a91230f5cb4e267c889aa61489ab2c4f70f35f921f934c1462cb6\",success=\"true\",verbose=\"true\",vidPid=\"\",warnings=\"\"} 1 1580385724726 # TYPE daemon_board_list counter daemon_board_list{installationID=\"ed6f1f22-1fbe-4b1f-84be-84d035b6369c\",success=\"true\"} 1 1580385724833 The telemetry settings are exposed via the telemetry section in the CLI configuration: telemetry : enabled : true addr : :9090","title":"Getting started"},{"location":"getting-started/#before-you-start","text":"arduino-cli is a container of commands and each command has its own dedicated help text that can be shown with the help command like this: $ arduino-cli help core Arduino Core operations.
